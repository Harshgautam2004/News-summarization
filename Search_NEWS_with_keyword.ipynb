              "'The White House has launched covid.gov, a dedicated website for COVID-19 guidance, including resources for treatment and testing. The site is meant to be a “one-stop shop” for all things related to COVID-19, including testing and treatment options, masks and vaccines. The website also provides county-level data from the CDC about community spread of COVID-19.The website includes a new “test-to-treat” locator that connects people with testing sites and treatment options in their area. “This program creates one-stop-shop locations where people can get a COVID-19 test and receive an oral antiviral treatment, if appropriate for them because they test positive and face high risks from COVID,” the White House wrote in a statement. “Since the launch earlier this month, there are now over 2,000 Test-to-Treat locations nationwide, including in pharmacy-based clinics, federally-qualified community health centers (FQHCs), and long-term care facilities.”Today, our Administration is launching https://t.co/NDM1ko6LYN, a new one-stop shop website to help all people in the U.S. gain even better access to lifesaving tools like vaccines, tests, treatments, and masks, as well as get the latest updates on COVID-19 in their area. pic.twitter.com/ps5ZPg1fQHWhile much of the information on covid.gov has already been available, the White House says it’s the first time that it’s brought all of its COVID-19 guidance and resources into one place. For example, it links to both vaccines.gov as well as the USPS site to order free COVID tests. It also includes links to find “high quality” masks, and resources on how to wear them.Subscribe to our newsletter or check out the latestPlease enter a valid email addressTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Megan CarnegieTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.In the midst of a Covid-19 flare-up and almost two calendar years into the pandemic, England last week dropped all its protective measures against the spread of the virus. In doing so, it is following the lead of countries like Denmark, Switzerland, and the Dominican Republic, which have removed legal requirements to self-isolate after a positive test.In these countries, there is no longer a support net that enables people to avoid financial penalties if they fall ill. Until now in England, employees have been able to claim statutory sick pay (SSP) from the first day of illness, which amounts to £96.35 ($127) a week. In a similar approach, countries like Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, Sweden, and France waived waiting periods for sick pay and sickness benefits to fight the spread of the virus.With Covid-19 infection levels in some areas of the UK at their highest since the pandemic began, the government’s decision to drop restrictions is problematic. UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s advice to cope with these changes was to “be more disciplined about not going into work when you are sick.” He encouraged Britons to break a lifelong habit of presenteeism and be more like German workers. Except Germans receive 100 percent of their pay for eight weeks if they fall ill, representing one of the highest sick-pay rates in Europe. Britons get the lowest. In the US, where the government is under pressure to drop Covid-19 restrictions and mask mandates, there is no statutory sick pay at all.Staying home when sick has never been part of the UK’s cultural fabric, where employees face pressure to not “let down the side.” Going into work when sick is the norm in the country, even when the illness could easily be passed on to others. Data from 2016 found that 86 percent of Britons would go into work with an infectious illness. The same research found that almost a quarter feel their manager would prefer it if they attended work in those circumstances. And so the contagion can spread.When the pandemic was in its early stages, there was some hope that it would end, or at least reduce, presenteeism in the workplace. However, in a country where statutory sick pay is getting worse, this is nothing but a pipe dream. In an era of remote work, the need to soldier on has prevailed. In the first year of the pandemic, Britons actually took fewer sick days than in 2019, reaching the lowest rate since 1995. Over half of hybrid workers (52 percent) and nearly half of remote workers (44 percent) said they feel obligated to work while unwell when they’re working remotely.The correlation between paid sick leave and sick days taken is hard to ignore. Workers offered the most generous sick pay take the most absences, and those offered the least, take the least. Employees in Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, and Belgium, who receive 100 percent of their wages from their first week of illness and for a month minimum, also take some of the most sick days in Europe. On average, Germans take 18.3 days off sick every year, while Britons take just 5.8. Incentivizing staying home from day one is particularly important in the context of Covid, as viral load and risk of infection peak quickly once symptoms begin and people can remain contagious for up to 10 days.Alex Collinson, an analysis and research officer at the UK’s Trades Union Congress (TUC), points out that the reintroduction of the three-day waiting period means that if someone isolates for five days of a week, they only get paid for two days. “It brings SSP down from £96 a week to £39, which is not enough to live off,” he says. “It’s a massive barrier to doing the right thing.”The TUC is proposing an increase to around £346 per week, as suggested by the Living Wage Foundation. “When people get sick, they should not be faced with financial hardship for taking time off,” says Collinson.\\xa0The new rules are particularly galling for those who are clinically vulnerable and may struggle to return to the workplace. Alison Crockford works in cybersecurity as an awareness manager and is immunosuppressed due to a kidney transplant. “I would love to go back to the office on a hybrid model, but now that testing and isolation is no longer the norm, it\\'s far more difficult for me to travel to the office and work safely,” she explains.“The perception that those with underlying conditions ‘were going to die anyway’ and couldn’t be happy, functioning members of society depresses me,” says the 41-year-old. “The ‘othering’ of anyone who’s not fortunate enough to be completely healthy right now is exhausting.”Beyond “getting better at not going to work while sick,” no part of England’s plan gives a credible explanation on how the immunocompromised and people with disabilities are meant to live and do their jobs alongside the virus.“We’ve worked well in the UK for some time to advance ability-status equality in the workplace, but the lifting of these measures takes a step back,” explains Simon Williams, a behavioral scientist at Swansea University. Indeed, data gathered by the UK\\'s Office for National Statistics (ONS) in mid-March shows that people with disabilities were more likely to think life would never return to normal, and 57 percent are avoiding close contact with those they don’t live with, compared to 41 percent of nondisabled. The majority are spending more time at home too.Throughout the pandemic, close attention has been paid to the number of Britons who\\'ve lost their lives to Covid, but less has been paid to those who have lost their health to long Covid. The true impact of this debilitating condition is beginning to come to light. According to self-reported stats from the ONS, 1.3 million Britons are experiencing symptoms lasting longer than four weeks since they were infected, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Some 18 percent report that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities has been limited “a lot.”Needless to say, the impact on businesses has—and will be—monumental. A quarter of British employers cite long Covid as the main cause for long-term health-related absence, in a survey of 804 organizations with over 4.3 million employees by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Some 46 percent have employees with long Covid. The Resolution Foundation think tank suggests there’s a high chance that it’s a contributing factor in the UK’s labor shortage and the “Great Resignation.” The same is true in the US, according to the Brookings Institution.The TUC is calling for the government to recognize long Covid as a disability. “It would protect workers under the Equality Act and, most importantly, give them the right to reasonable adjustments at work,” says Collinson. “That includes everything from flexible working arrangements to longer rest breaks and special software and equipment.”An innate work ethic, pressure from the top, and financial worries are all contributing factors, but as employees return to offices, Williams says, this overarching presenteeism is terrible for public health. “It contributes to avoidable transmission of infectious illnesses—not just Covid—which isn’t cost-effective for businesses,” he says. “A lot of countries have much better sick pay, and raising it would help to change a culturally ingrained habit of feeling unwell, complaining about it, but doing it anyway.”With absenteeism now a luxury many workers can’t afford, the pressure is on individual businesses to foster environments that recognize all levels of vulnerability. “We do have to live with Covid and focus on personal responsibility,” says Williams. “But there’s a danger that if we say personal responsibility or policy, we throw the baby out with the bathwater.”The best approach is a set of policies that entrust people with the ability to exercise responsibility and be cautious. At the very least, if governments want people to self isolate—and they should—they need to get paid enough to live on. Perhaps then, they could be more like the Germans.More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Anyone can read what you share.By David LeonhardtThe short-term and long-term flaws with the country’s current Covid-19 policy are quite different.In the short term, the main problem is a lack of demand for Covid vaccines and treatments: Not enough people are trying to get them. In the longer term — by the second half of this year — the bigger problem may end up being a lack of supply, especially if cases surge again.I think this distinction has gotten lost in some of the public discussion. Yesterday, President Biden called for additional Covid funding, after Congress had left out such money from its most recent spending bill because of a disagreement over how to pay for it.“We need to secure additional supply now,” Biden said in a brief speech, shortly before receiving his second booster shot onstage. “We can’t wait until we find ourselves in the midst of another surge to act. It’ll be too late.”Biden is right that the lack of funding creates problems. To ensure an adequate supply of vaccines and treatments later this year, the government probably needs to take action soon. Democrats and Republicans have been negotiating over a possible deal this week.But the potential funding shortfall is nowhere near the entire problem. A lack of money is not preventing many Americans from getting vaccinated or getting valuable treatments right now. Even if Congress does pass more Covid funding, the country will still face a problem that is more about information and persuasion than dollars.For months, the United States has been awash in Covid vaccine shots, and many Americans would benefit from getting one. About one-quarter of adults remain unvaccinated, while roughly another quarter are vaccinated but not boosted, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A booster shot sharply reduces the chances of severe Covid illness, especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and immunocompromised.I know that last point may sound counterintuitive. The elderly and immunocompromised, even if boosted, face a higher risk of severe illness than a healthy, younger person. But a booster shot still reduces the risk more for a vulnerable person than for an average person. It’s a common dynamic in medicine: Treatments tend to be most valuable for the most vulnerable even if they do not eliminate risk.Despite the huge value of additional vaccine shots, many Americans simply aren’t getting one. The number of shots given per day, including both initial doses and boosters, has fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign, in early 2021.Including first, second and booster doses2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.March2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.March2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.MarchSource: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBy The New York TimesWhat might help?Employer and customer mandates would probably nudge more people to get initial shots. Previous employer mandates have generally caused more people to get vaccinated and only a tiny share to quit or be fired. But mandates have fallen out of fashion. Even some politically liberal places, like New York City and Washington, D.C., have been dropping theirs recently.Boosting more people seems as if it should be more feasible, because it involves people who have already received a shot. Still, boosters are lagging. Many Americans seem confused about how much a booster shot matters.The scientific evidence suggests that everybody who is eligible should get a first booster shot. A second booster shot — now available to people 50 and older, among others — may also make sense, although the benefits appear smaller. And if you are boosted and have already had Omicron, you probably don’t need another booster yet, Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research notes (as part of his helpful overview of the evidence).The story is similar with both Evusheld (a drug that appears to boost immunity among the immunocompromised) and post-infection treatments that reduce the chance of severe illness. They are widely available, yet many people remain unaware of them.Many doctors also seem uncertain how and when to prescribe them. “Doctors are beginning to use this,” a Biden administration official told me, “but it takes a while for things to get absorbed in medical practice.”Biden yesterday announced a new federal website — Covid.gov — where people can search for pharmacies near them that have both Evusheld and the treatments. I found most parts of it simple to use. But I also thought that Rob Relyea, a Microsoft engineer who has become an advocate for the immunocompromised, made a good critique on Twitter: The Evusheld information is too hard to find.The bottom line is that Americans would benefit from hearing a series of clear, repeated messages:Getting a booster shot may save your life.Many immunocompromised people would probably be helped by Evusheld, and it’s available.Vulnerable people — like the elderly — should talk with a doctor as soon as they test positive for Covid and seek treatments that can reduce its severity, like Paxlovid or molnupiravir.As Biden said yesterday, “America has the tools to protect people.”If more people become aware of the treatments, however, some of them are likely to run low later this year. And if the federal government waits until then to act, it may discover that other countries have bought the available supply. “You can’t snap your fingers and buy the stuff,” the Biden administration official told me.Already, the administration has reduced shipments of one kind of treatment — monoclonal antibodies — that it is sending to states. It has also said it would cut back on new orders of Evusheld in the next several days.A Covid bill would likely cost $10 billion to $15 billion, or less than 0.25 percent of the annual federal budget. Congressional Republicans have said that the money should be diverted from another area, rather than add to the deficit. My colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, who covers the pandemic from Washington, said Congress was likely to agree on a funding source soon, perhaps before lawmakers leave for their April recess.

After two years of battling Covid-19 and related burnout, nurses say it’s been a welcome relief.“There\\'s two levels of burnout: There\\'s ‘we’re short this weekend’ burnout, and then there\\'s pandemic burnout, which our care teams are experiencing right now,” says Abigail Hamilton, a former ICU and emergency room nurse that manages nursing staff support programs at the hospital.Moxi is one of several specialized delivery robots that has been developed in recent years to ease the strain on health care workers. Even before the pandemic, nearly half of US nurses felt that their workplace lacked adequate work–life balance. The emotional toll of seeing patients die and colleagues infected at such a large scale—and fear of bringing Covid-19 home to family—has made feelings of burnout worse. Studies also found that burnout can have long-term consequences for nurses, including cognitive impacts and insomnia years after the exhaustion of their early careers. The world already had a nurse shortage going into the pandemic; now, roughly two out of three nurses in the US say they have considered leaving the profession, according to a survey from the National Nurses United union.In some places the shortage is leading to higher wages for permanent staff and for temporary travel nurses. In countries such as Finland, nurses are demanding better pay and going on strike. But it’s also paved the way for more robots in health care settings.At the forefront of this trend is Moxi, which has spent the pandemic rolling down the halls of some of the largest hospitals in the country, carrying objects like a smartphone or beloved teddy bear to patients in emergency rooms when Covid-19 protocol kept family members from bedsides.Moxi was created by Diligent Robotics, a company cofounded in 2017 by Vivian Chu, a former Google X researcher, and Andrea Thomaz, who developed Moxi while working as an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The roboticists met when Thomaz advised Chu at Georgia Tech’s Socially Intelligent Machines Lab. The first Moxi commercial deployment came months after the start of the pandemic. About 15 Moxi robots are now operational in US hospitals, with an additional 60 scheduled to deploy later this year.“In 2018, any hospital that was thinking about working with us, it was a special project for the CFO or innovation project about the hospital of the future,” says Diligent Robotics CEO Andrea Thomaz. “What we saw over the last two years is that almost every single health care system is thinking about robotics and automation or has robotics and automation on their strategic agenda.”A range of robots have been developed in recent years to carry out health care tasks like disinfecting hospital wards or assisting physical therapists. Robots that touch people—like Robear, which helped lift elderly people out of bed in Japan—remain largely experimental, due in part to liability and regulatory requirements. Far more common are specialized delivery robots.Moxi is equipped with a robotic arm and can greet passersby with cooing sounds and heart eyes on a digital face. But in practice Moxi is less of a caregiver and more like Tug, another hospital delivery robot, or Burro, a robot helping farm workers in California grape vineyards. A camera on the front and lidar sensor on the back help Moxi map the floors of hospitals and spot people and items it should avoid.Nurses can hail Moxi robots from kiosks at nursing stations or send the robot a task via text message. Moxi might be used to transport items that are too big to fit into a tube system, like IV pumps; lab samples and other fragile cargo; or specialty items, like a slice of birthday cake.A survey of nurses who worked with delivery robots similar to Moxi in a hospital in Cyprus found that roughly half expressed concern that robots represent a threat to their jobs, but they have a long way to go before they could conceivably replace humans. Moxi still needs help with basic tasks. For example, Moxi might have to ask a human to press an elevator button for a specific floor.More concerning, the cybersecurity risks hospital delivery robots present aren’t very well understood. Last week, security firm Cynerio showed that exploiting a vulnerability can allow hackers to take remote control of Tug robots or open patients up to privacy violations. (No comparable bugs have been found in Moxi robots, and the company says it’s taking steps to ensure its “security position.”)Around the time of Moxi’s first commercial deployment in 2020, an American Nurses Association–supported case study assessed Moxi trials at hospitals in Dallas, Houston, and Galveston, Texas. Researchers cautioned that use of such robots requires more thorough supply management by hospital staff, because robots don’t read expiration dates; using expired bandages can increase risk of infections.A majority of the 21 nurses interviewed as part of the review said Moxi gave them more time to talk with patients being discharged from the hospital. Numerous nurses said Moxi saved them energy, brought joy to patients and their families, and ensured that patients always had water when it was time for them to take their medication. “I could do it faster, but it’s better for Moxi to do it so I can do something else more useful,” said one of the surveyed nurses. In less positive feedback, nurses complained that Moxi had trouble maneuvering through cramped halls during the morning rush or anticipating needs by accessing electronic health records. Another said some patients were suspicious of “the robot’s eyes recording them.” Authors of that case study concluded that Moxi is incapable of delivering skilled nursing care and is best suited to focusing on low-risk, repetitive tasks that can save nurses time.Those types of tasks can represent big business. In addition to its recent expansion into new hospitals, Diligent Robotics announced the closure of a $30 million funding round last week. The company will use the funding in part to more closely integrate Moxi’s software with electronic health records in order to carry out tasks without the need for a nurse or doctor to make a request.In her experience, Abigail Hamilton of Mary Washington Hospital says burnout has the power to force people into early retirement, push them toward temporary travel nurse work, impact their relationships with loved ones, or make them leave the industry altogether.Still, she says, the simple things Moxi does can make a difference. It can save nurses the 30 minutes it might take to go from the fifth floor to the basement to pick up medication that can’t go through the tube system from the pharmacy. And picking up after-hour meals for patients is one of Moxi’s most popular tasks. Since two Moxi robots began operating in the halls of Mary Washington Hospital in February, they’ve given workers back approximately 600 hours of time.“As a society, we’re not who we were in February 2020,” Hamilton said when explaining why her hospital uses robots. “We have to think of different ways to support caregivers at the bedside.”Updated 4/29/2022 9:55 am ET: This story has been updated to correct that the robot is just over 4 feet tall, not nearly 6 feet as previously stated, and to clarify that it was Thomaz who advised Chu at Georgia Tech.More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast.

For years before the pandemic, the Hungarian-American biochemist had been working to realize the therapeutic potential of mRNA—first trying to create a synthetic version of the messenger molecule that wouldn’t trigger the body’s inflammatory response, and then, once she and colleague Drew Weissman had achieved that goal, trying to get the medical and scientific community to pay attention.She had envisioned the technology being used to treat those recovering from heart attacks and strokes. But it was the frantic race for a Covid vaccine that earned Karikó belated global recognition. The work she and her colleagues had done on mRNA provided the foundation for Moderna and BioNTech to quickly develop Covid vaccines that have now saved millions of lives.Traditional vaccines train the immune system by introducing it to harmless versions of whole viruses—the body learns to recognize the virus’s key features, such as SARS-CoV-2’s infamous spike protein. These new mRNA vaccines found a more elegant way to achieve the same goal, using messenger RNA—a genetic molecule found throughout nature that’s used to transmit information within and between cells—to provide the body with a set of instructions on how to make the spike protein itself, essentially borrowing the body’s internal machinery and turning it into a photocopier.This difference allowed mRNA vaccines to be designed, created, and approved in record time. Over the past 18 months, mRNA technology has been injected into billions of arms and has helped slow the devastating impact of the pandemic. But its long-term impact—accelerated by Covid—could be even greater. “It seems like the sky is the limit,” says Karikó. “Previously the belief was not there.”Dozens of clinical trials are now underway for new forms of the mRNA vaccine—targeting everything from malaria to Zika, herpes, and cytomegalovirus. Last month, Moderna—which was founded in 2014 to explore the potential of mRNA—announced it had started Phase I clinical trials for two mRNA-based HIV vaccines. “The timeline for what can be achieved using the mRNA platform is so much better,” says Carl Dieffenbach, director of the Division of AIDS at the US National Institutes of Health, who is overseeing those trials.There was some work on mRNA happening before the pandemic—Moderna had spent years on the lipid envelope that encases the strand of mRNA in the vaccine, for instance. “Like all overnight successes, mRNA has been in development for a long time,” says Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority invested in an mRNA vaccine for Zika in 2016, but “the urgency sort of trailed off” as the outbreak subsided, Hatchett says. There had also been tentative attempts to develop mRNA platforms for other coronaviruses, such as MERS, work that proved crucial when Covid broke out. Moderna was able to tweak its MERS vaccine for the new disease, meaning its Covid vaccine entered clinical trials just 66 days after SARS-CoV-2’s genetic sequence was published.It’s true that mRNA vaccines would probably have come to market eventually, but they were on what Dieffenbach calls “a leisurely stroll.” Covid “pressure-tested” them—advancing their emergence by years or decades. Karikó remembers organizing the first mRNA conference in 2013 and says that nobody in attendance would have expected an FDA-approved product less than 10 years later. “Because of the success against Covid, we’re going to see tremendous investment, and we’re going to learn just how flexible it is and how finely we can target,” says Hatchett.One of mRNA’s strengths is its “remarkable agility,” as Hatchett puts it. Its only raw ingredients are the four nucleotides that form the “letters” of the RNA sequence, so it can be designed and made pretty rapidly. “Biological manufacturing is very hard and temperamental and has been difficult to introduce in many environments. It’s taken India decades to build up the vaccine manufacturing capability they have,” says Hatchett. “It may be easier for countries to develop an mRNA production capacity than traditional biological manufacturing capability.”Developing countries could, Hatchett suggests, leapfrog over traditional vaccine-manufacturing processes and go straight to mRNA—mRNA plants are already being planned in countries across Africa and Asia. After Covid, they could be quickly repurposed to create vaccines for other diseases—all you need to do is change the order of the bases in the mRNA to give the body a new set of instructions. There are also far fewer concerns about purity or contamination than with traditional vaccines—the body quickly translates, expresses, and breaks down the strand of mRNA.“mRNA is completely interchangeable,” says Jackie Miller, senior vice president for infectious diseases at Moderna. “What changes between the different vaccines is the DNA template that we utilize to synthesize the messenger RNA, but across all of our vaccine portfolio, we’re using the same lipid nanoparticle.”CEPI wants to use that flexibility to create a library of mRNA vaccines against each of the viral families known to cause human disease. This would cost $20 billion to $30 billion, Hatchett estimates, but it would enable a rapid response to any new outbreaks. “The lesson from 2020 is that 326 days [the time from sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 to administering the first doses of a Covid vaccine outside of trials] is terrific, astounding, and not fast enough,” he says. CEPI wants to be in a position to make a vaccine for emerging threats within 100 days. “mRNA is an essential, critical component of our being able to achieve that mission,” Hatchett says.CEPI’s other goal is to improve access to mRNA vaccines, which still need to be stored and transported at extremely cold temperatures (–80°C for Pfizer/BioNtech, –20°C for Moderna), which makes reaching remote areas challenging. The cold chain requirement and the cost are two reasons the majority of mRNA vaccines have been purchased and administered by higher-income countries. In India, 88 percent of people received the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is based on a different technology, doesn’t need to be kept so cold, and has been made available far more cheaply; in the US the overwhelming majority got mRNA vaccines.That problem will never go away completely—mRNA is inherently unstable, Karikó says, to the point that vaccine shipments can be ruined by a bumpy road—but there is a trade-off between temperature and shelf life; you can store vaccines at less extreme temperatures, but they will degrade faster. “In some parts of the world, this is not the most convenient presentation,” Miller says. Although mRNA could eventually be cheaper than traditional vaccine manufacturing, that’s not the case today—and ensuring equitable access could require some technical breakthroughs. Dieffenbach suggests freeze-drying vaccine particles for easier transport and storage as one potential solution—eventually mRNA could be squirted up the nose, inhaled as a powder, or applied using a patch. Self-amplifying RNA, which replicates itself inside the body, could enable lower doses, which could lessen the risk of side effects.Eventually, protection against multiple strains of a virus could be administered in a single shot. There are efforts to make universal vaccines for coronaviruses or influenza that would target their stable features—like the stalk of an influenza virus—getting around their ability to shift and mutate. “Even for those coronaviruses that are still in the bat and have not jumped to us, we will be protected,” Karikó says.Or, if that doesn’t work, there’s also the “sledgehammer” approach of putting multiple strains of mRNA into a single jab—a whole manual of instructions the body can use to recognize different strains of a virus. “Our goal ultimately is to develop these individual antigens but combine them in ways that if you’re getting a seasonal booster you don’t need to get multiple, you can get a single booster to cover against the most likely respiratory pathogens,” Miller says. A future mRNA flu jab—the most likely next step after Covid—could comprise specific instructions for that season’s most prevalent strain, but also primers for various different strains so that if there is a pandemic of, say, H7N9 flu, people’s immune systems won’t be going into it completely blind.There’s a world of applications beyond vaccines, too. Messenger RNA gives scientists and doctors a way to make essentially any protein they would like directly inside the body. Rather than coding for a spike protein to encourage the body to make antibodies against it, mRNA could be used to teach the body how to make those antibodies directly: Someone who survived an outbreak of an emerging disease could have their antibodies cloned, and the instructions for how to make them could be shared with others using mRNA, suggests Karikó.Years ago, she made a list of all the diseases she thought it was reasonable to treat using mRNA. There were more than 30 on the list, covering everything from cancer to everyday aches and pains. The design of the lipid coating that surrounds the mRNA could be tweaked to get the molecule to different places in the body: the lungs, the spleen, the bone marrow, depending on the exact condition or disease that needs to be treated.A protein that aids healing applied directly to a wound will wash away in hours with the flow of blood. But mRNA could be used to teach the cells in the wounded area to make and secrete that protein themselves. The body of a child with a genetic defect that means they can’t make a vital protein could be taught to make that protein, with mRNA instructions sent precisely to the area where it’s needed.“We always wanted it to be that everybody could use it,” says Karikó, from a hotel room in Tokyo, where she’s quarantining before a meeting with the Emperor of Japan—a sign of the global impact mRNA has already had. But we’ve only scratched the surface. If the logistical and technical hurdles can be overcome, and the technology can be distributed evenly, mRNA has the potential to transform every strand of medicine. “In the next 10 years, you will see unbelievable progress,” she says.Updated 4-19-2022 5:00 pm ET: This story was corrected to state that the letters of mRNA are nucleotides, not amino acids, and that it was the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, not CEPI, that funded the development of an mRNA vaccine for Zika in 2016.\\xa0More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast.

This is The Daily.Throughout the pandemic, as countries have struggled with disease and death, one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared— Central and Western Africa. My colleague, Stephanie Nolen, traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic.It’s Thursday, April 7.So, Stephanie, you’re a global health reporter at The Times. Tell me about the kind of reporting that you’ve been doing during the pandemic.So, generally, a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world, things like infectious disease, malaria, tuberculosis, H.I.V. But of course, in the Covid era, that’s mostly meant reporting on Covid. And I’ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world. And in February, I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries, and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven’t paid as much attention to in the pandemic.So I arrived in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, at what was the height of the Omicron wave. And I was coming from Canada, which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic. And I hired a vehicle with a driver, and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests. And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there, and it was really startling.We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying. There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it. Nobody had a mask on. And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people, are you worried about Covid? I mean, they knew what I was talking about, but they couldn’t fathom why I would be concerned. It was like time travel back to 2019, like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow.And right away, I thought, I need to understand what’s happening here. Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here? Or it is here, but it’s not making people sick? It’s not killing people? And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months, this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa, but until I saw it, I really didn’t understand just how puzzling this was. And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery.Stephanie, to that point, what’s the big picture here? I mean, tell me what’s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic. Catch me up on how it’s played out.So I’ll start with South Africa because that’s the country in sub-Saharan Africa that we know the most about. So South Africa, of course, has had a pretty rough time. The Beta variant was first identified there. The Omicron variant was first identified there. They’ve caused bad waves. We know that there have been probably 300,000 deaths caused by Covid in South Africa.As you move through the continent, it gets murkier. East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya, Uganda. There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full. But they’re rare stories. And as you move into Central and then Western Africa, there have been even fewer reports like this, right? Much, much lower reports of deaths. Sierra Leone is a country of 8 million people, and they’ve reported a total of 7,700 Covid cases and just 125 deaths.That seems incredibly low.It really is.So how did you start to answer that question, Stephanie? The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid. What did you do first?So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases. And the town that I was in, Kamakwie, happened to have the regional Covid coordinator’s office there. So I went across town and walked into the office.And it was completely empty, except for the district coordinator, the Covid coordinator, who I found sitting behind his desk, all alone in an otherwise completely empty office. He had a shiny new laptop in front of him, but no internet connection and, indeed, no power. And when I asked him what he knew about cases, he told me really proudly that they’d only had 11 since the start of the pandemic.Oh, wow, 11 for roughly what kind of population?Oh, it’s about 125,000 people in this district.Wow.So that was kind of shocking. But then the question was, well, how do you know? So I asked him what was happening with testing. And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital. So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital, thinking, OK, maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing.This is the hospital of the same region?It’s the district hospital serving those 125,000 people. And there was a lab, and there were three busy technicians in that lab. And when I said, what are you doing in terms of Covid testing, they were pretty blunt. There’s not a lot of resources in this hospital. So what they do when people come in is they triage. They test first for malaria. And if you don’t have malaria, they’ll test you for typhoid. And if you don’t have typhoid, then they’ll test you for Covid. And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point, they figured out what they have.So, Stephanie, it sounds like from your reporting what you’re finding is that, number one, the regional coordinator is not doing the testing. And number two, at the hospital, they have so many other urgent diseases, malaria, for example, that Covid is just really the last thing on their list.Exactly. There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country. So I went back down south to Freetown, to the capital. And I went to see Dr. Austin Demby, who is the health minister of Sierra Leone. And I went into his office in the ministry.So I cover global health for The Times. And I am meant to travel the world, although, obviously, the last couple of years, that has not been a thing.And told him why I was in Sierra Leone.I would love to hear from you how it’s been going and what the challenges are.Yeah, so thank you very much. And by the way—And he told me about how he used to work for the C.D.C. in the United States. And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister.I was appointed on the 10th of February last year.And that was peak pandemic. So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point. But also—And on the 14th, Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak.—just a couple of days after Dr. Demby came back to take up this job, an Ebola outbreak was declared.Oh, wow.So this is a guy who really knows a thing or two about pandemics.The lessons learned from Ebola are extremely helpful. I mean—And we started off by talking a little bit about 2014, ‘15, ‘16, when that last really terrible Ebola outbreak, you might remember, went through this region. 11,000 people died. It was really devastating for Sierra Leone.When we had Ebola here, people knew what hand-sanitizing was. People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever, social distancing. People knew about care.And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid.So that gives us a headstart. And what that meant was Sierra Leone was the last country in Africa to report a case. And Sierra Leone has constantly reported very, very low numbers throughout all of this outbreak.And when I started asking Dr. Demby about Covid, he attributed some of their low case numbers to the fact that they’d been able to very quickly mount a strong response.But then how does Dr. Demby explain the things that you were seeing in your reporting, Stephanie? I mean, in the regional coordinator’s office, in the hospital, this fact that people didn’t seem to be doing any testing.Right, so I asked him about that.Can I ask you about that? Because it’s quite extraordinary for me to come— I live in Canada— and to travel from a place where people are pandemic obsessed, right, to a place where it’s clearly not on people’s minds. How confident are you in your surveillance?I said, what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here? How much are you testing? How much are you looking?So that’s a really interesting point. Again, you have to be careful with this, but I think most of the testing that’s occurring is occurring at the airport, which is more entry and exit, you know?And he acknowledged freely that there’s very little testing happening.And so when we say we have silent districts, they’re silent either because there are no cases or because we’re not testing them, yeah? But I have a feeling that there’s a lot of transmission going on in here.So it sounds like the health minister of Sierra Leone is confirming the theory that cases are being severely undercounted.Yeah, definitely.There was a survey that was done a while back that indicated close to 50 percent of people have been exposed.Do you believe it?Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is a study that was done by Tulane.And in fact, he told me about some recent research that had looked for antibody levels in the population and had found that probably half the people in Sierra Leone when that study was done had already been exposed to Covid.I think we’re looking at doing another survey now to look at the antibody levels in the country. But I would not be surprised if it’s very, very high.And Stephanie, is there other data to back that up?Well, there is, actually. There’s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two-thirds of people across sub-Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies. There’s other data sources, looking particularly at West Africa, that show that 75 percent of people have got Covid antibodies. And remember, when these studies were done, only 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent of people had had access to vaccination. So if you’ve got antibodies, it’s because you had an infection.So that kind of answers your original question, right? Clearly, a lot of people in Sierra Leone did have Covid.Yeah, absolutely. And in fact, Dr. Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation. They know lots of people have been infected.However, I’m buoyed by the fact that no matter what there is, there’s no evident excess deaths that are occurring that’s very visible.But he also talked about something else they’re seeing— or actually, what they’re not seeing. He was just totally adamant that they’re not seeing the death rates that we’ve seen in other parts of the world.Everybody else, there are multiple waves in Italy now, in Germany, everywhere else. People are still dying in the U.S. But when you look here, you see that people are still getting sick. We’re still getting cases. But you don’t get the kind of enormity that others are seeing.And remember, Sierra Leone has this surveillance system that’s a legacy of that terrible Ebola outbreak.The thing is we also have a very active surveillance system. Every week, we got reports of all of the deaths around.And he says, look, if there was a spike in deaths in one region of this country anywhere, we would know about it, and it’s just not happening.We haven’t seen any excess mortality that could alert us that there’s something going on.Hmm. Interesting. So it sounds like, Stephanie, from what you’re saying, Sierra Leone and a lot of sub-Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic. But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies, had Covid. And if we follow what happened in the U.S., they should have a lot of deaths, right? But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died.Well, so there I am with a whole new mystery, right? If lots of people have Covid, but they don’t have deaths to report, what’s going on?We’ll be right back.So, Stephanie, how did you go about digging into this other part of the mystery, which had to do with how many people in Sierra Leone actually died of Covid?So I started calling up epidemiologists in all different parts of sub-Saharan Africa, people I’ve known for a long while. And I started asking them this question of, what do you think is happening? And after a lot of conversations, I kind of was left with two really different theories that would explain how even though we know there are lots of Covid infections in Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, how it could be that people don’t seem to be dying.And what are those theories? Lay those out for me.Well, the first one is that there is no mystery. There’s just lousy data on deaths. There’s not some miraculous thing happening in West and Central Africa or in regions that report lower Covid deaths. The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them. And the second theory is that, in fact, there’s no way that thousands and millions of deaths have been missed. Something else is protecting people. Something else is going on that means people are getting infected with Covid, but they don’t get sick or they don’t die at the same rates.OK, so let’s start with the first theory because that one seems pretty logical to me. I mean, if it’s clear that cases were being undercounted, then probably deaths were being undercounted, right?Yeah, I think this is a really strong argument. We know that death registration in much of sub-Saharan Africa is really, really poorly done. There are a lot of countries where only 5% or 6% of deaths are ever registered with a civil authority.Oh, wow.People don’t typically die in medical facilities or hospitals. They most often will die at home. And they get buried in a small village graveyard. And so that death never gets reported. An excellent Zambian public health researcher I spoke to told me about a study he’s been doing that found that nearly 90% of the bodies in the main morgue in Zambia were positive for Covid.This was at the height of the Delta wave. And he said, look, there’s just no reason to think that fewer Zambians would be dying or Ethiopians or Sierra Leoneans, right? There’s no inherent reason why there would be fewer deaths here, just the record keeping is really weak.And there’s a model that draws together lots and lots of different data sets that the economist has been running that says there could be up to three million Covid excess deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.Oh, wow. So three million deaths that basically have been uncounted.That’s the argument. Now, look, to be clear, that model says the deaths have been undercounted all over the world. We know that that’s true. But according to this model, the problem of undercounting is the most severe in Africa.And does that hold water?Well, a lot of people that I spoke to say there’s no question some deaths have been missed, but they’re really not buying it. And that includes the chief of the Covid response for the W.H.O., the World Health Organization in sub-Saharan Africa. He said to me there’s just no way, there’s just no way that we have missed millions of deaths. Models are useful to a point, but there are lots of other ways of seeing deaths, right?When Zambia had a bad Delta wave, there were bodies stacked outside the morgue. I mean, a place like Sierra Leone holds really, really big funerals. People say there’s just no way that there could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths and that we’ve just missed them.And Stephanie, if it were true that there were high case numbers, but low deaths from Covid in Sierra Leone, what would explain that?Well, that is an excellent question. So, again, there are lots of theories. The leading one— and I think that whatever else is true, this is a part of it— is age, right? Sub-Saharan Africa has a median age of 19, right? Sierra Leone is right around that as well. And that compares with 43 in Europe, 38 in the United States. And so we know that Covid is much more deadly for older people who have lived long enough to have developed the co-morbidities, such as diabetes, that makes Covid really deadly. The virus is far less likely to kill young people. And they’re often asymptomatic altogether.Another argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with temperature, the fact that it’s, obviously, really quite warm in all of these countries, and people mostly live their life outdoors. Obviously, if you’re talking about people who are in Sierra Leone, primarily subsistence farmers spending the day in their fields, they’re not getting exposed to Covid the way they would on a crowded subway train, although, of course, now we know that huge numbers of people actually have been infected. So that theory is a bit questionable.And then finally, the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid, or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone, you’ve had repeated bouts of malaria. You’ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease, that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid.Hmm. That’s interesting. And how do these three factors hold up when you compare Sierra Leone to another similar country that had a really bad time with Covid?Well, we can talk about India. India has reported half a million Covid deaths, but it’s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to 4 million people who’ve died of the virus. So India also has a young population, right? There, the median age is about 28. It’s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors. And there’s regions of India that have very high rates of infection with malaria. There are lots of other pathogens in circulation, so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things.So we know that those factors were not protective in India. On the other hand, India is a much more dense place. It’s much more connected. It has much better transportation. So it’s not a straight comparison to Sierra Leone, but it’s enough to suggest that those three things alone don’t cover it as an explanation.So it sounds like what India is showing us is that these factors you’re talking about, they’re all playing something of a role, but there’s not a single one of them that solves the mystery entirely.Yeah, that’s exactly right.So I’m wondering, Stephanie, in all the reporting you’ve done, how do you even begin to figure out what’s true? I mean, is it that Covid deaths in Africa are really being undercounted, or that Africans have this really unique immunity to Covid?Where I wound up is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. If you’re in a place like Sierra Leone that has incredibly high infant mortality— it has the highest maternal mortality in the world. Thousands of people die of malaria. There is all kinds of other infectious diseases that people are prey to. It is possible that Covid could cause a rise in the number of deaths that wouldn’t necessarily show up the way it would in a country with overall lower mortality figures.On the other hand, I believe people in Sierra Leone when they say to me, there have been no extra deaths in my village this year. One person died, two people died. It’s just like all the other years. Nothing unusual has happened here.Right.What I can also tell you is that I was able to sit down and read all of the serious research on the topic in a single morning. It’s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters, right? It matters for Sierra Leone, for sub-Saharan Africa, but it also matters to everybody else.What are the stakes, Stephanie? Why does it matter?Well, it matters for a couple of reasons. In terms of why it matters for the world, if there is something going on that means people really aren’t getting sick with Covid or aren’t dying from Covid at the same rate in West and Central Africa, in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, understanding where that protection, where that immunity is coming from, that could help us in lots of ways. It could help develop better treatments. It could help with another generation of vaccines.So it matters for protecting the world, but it also matters for sub-Saharan Africa, for Sierra Leone. There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate 70 percent of people. And Sierra Leone is scrambling to do that.Well, you have now a situation where COVAX came through. The World Bank came through with funding that allowed us to buy about $4 million worth of vaccines.When I spoke to the health minister, Dr. Demby, he was talking about how there’s a lot of resources coming into the country right now to do Covid vaccination. But—At the same time we have the Ebola vaccination going on, there was a polio outbreak. So all of this was going on at the same time. The same staff was doing all of this.That is an enormous challenge in a place like Sierra Leone with a health system that was already really struggling to respond to what people needed.And not only that, you had to raise awareness, bring people in, and vaccinate them.And then trying to convince young healthy people to get a shot for a disease that, as we’ve just been talking about, they really don’t think as a risk to them.It becomes a real burden when people are not sick.So it sounds like there’s this tension here, right? I mean, public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate 70 percent of Africa. But Dr. Demby is finding that that’s a really complicated thing to do, and especially complicated when it’s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country.I think there’s a growing— it started as a whisper and then a mutter, and now it’s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa makes sense, whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources.My responsibility is, how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid, but at the same time, be a resource for rebuilding health systems?I think all things being equal, Dr. Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn’t killing people now, the next variant might be deadly. But—The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long.He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system, he’s facing these trade-offs. I would say there are artificial trade-offs between addressing one disease or another. And so he’s in this position where he’s having to really ask himself, what should he do with the limited resources that he has?Stephanie, thank you.It’s a pleasure.We’ll be right back.Here’s what else you need to know today.On Wednesday, in response to atrocities in the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies moved to impose full sanctions against Russia’s largest financial institutions.The Biden administration, together with the European Union, imposed strict sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, which holds over a third of the country’s financial assets, and Alfa-Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks. The administration also announced that it would block access to U.S.-held financial assets for family members and close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Putin’s two adult daughters.And Pentagon officials said that Russia has withdrawn all of its troops from the territory around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Chernihiv, a major city in the north. Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago, but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self-proclaimed pullout could be a ruse. As many as 40,000 Russian troops have now left the territory and are rearming and resupplying before launching what Western officials believe will be a renewed focus on Ukraine’s east and south.Meanwhile, a video posted online and verified by The New York Times appears to show Ukrainian mistreatment of Russian prisoners. In the video, a Russian soldier can be seen with a jacket pulled over his head, gasping for air, before he is shot by a Ukrainian soldier. At least three other men believed to be Russian soldiers lay dead beside him, one with his hands tied behind his back.Today’s episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja, Rikki Novetsky and Rob Szypko, with help from Michael Symon Johnson.

I’m Sabrina Tavernise. See you tomorrow.transcriptFrom The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.Throughout the pandemic, as countries have struggled with disease and death, one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared— Central and Western Africa. My colleague, Stephanie Nolen, traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic.It’s Thursday, April 7.So, Stephanie, you’re a global health reporter at The Times. Tell me about the kind of reporting that you’ve been doing during the pandemic.So, generally, a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world, things like infectious disease, malaria, tuberculosis, H.I.V. But of course, in the Covid era, that’s mostly meant reporting on Covid. And I’ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world. And in February, I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries, and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven’t paid as much attention to in the pandemic.So I arrived in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, at what was the height of the Omicron wave. And I was coming from Canada, which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic. And I hired a vehicle with a driver, and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests. And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there, and it was really startling.We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying. There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it. Nobody had a mask on. And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people, are you worried about Covid? I mean, they knew what I was talking about, but they couldn’t fathom why I would be concerned. It was like time travel back to 2019, like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow.And right away, I thought, I need to understand what’s happening here. Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here? Or it is here, but it’s not making people sick? It’s not killing people? And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months, this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa, but until I saw it, I really didn’t understand just how puzzling this was. And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery.Stephanie, to that point, what’s the big picture here? I mean, tell me what’s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic. Catch me up on how it’s played out.So I’ll start with South Africa because that’s the country in sub-Saharan Africa that we know the most about. So South Africa, of course, has had a pretty rough time. The Beta variant was first identified there. The Omicron variant was first identified there. They’ve caused bad waves. We know that there have been probably 300,000 deaths caused by Covid in South Africa.As you move through the continent, it gets murkier. East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya, Uganda. There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full. But they’re rare stories. And as you move into Central and then Western Africa, there have been even fewer reports like this, right? Much, much lower reports of deaths. Sierra Leone is a country of 8 million people, and they’ve reported a total of 7,700 Covid cases and just 125 deaths.That seems incredibly low.It really is.So how did you start to answer that question, Stephanie? The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid. What did you do first?So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases. And the town that I was in, Kamakwie, happened to have the regional Covid coordinator’s office there. So I went across town and walked into the office.And it was completely empty, except for the district coordinator, the Covid coordinator, who I found sitting behind his desk, all alone in an otherwise completely empty office. He had a shiny new laptop in front of him, but no internet connection and, indeed, no power. And when I asked him what he knew about cases, he told me really proudly that they’d only had 11 since the start of the pandemic.Oh, wow, 11 for roughly what kind of population?Oh, it’s about 125,000 people in this district.Wow.So that was kind of shocking. But then the question was, well, how do you know? So I asked him what was happening with testing. And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital. So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital, thinking, OK, maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing.This is the hospital of the same region?It’s the district hospital serving those 125,000 people. And there was a lab, and there were three busy technicians in that lab. And when I said, what are you doing in terms of Covid testing, they were pretty blunt. There’s not a lot of resources in this hospital. So what they do when people come in is they triage. They test first for malaria. And if you don’t have malaria, they’ll test you for typhoid. And if you don’t have typhoid, then they’ll test you for Covid. And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point, they figured out what they have.So, Stephanie, it sounds like from your reporting what you’re finding is that, number one, the regional coordinator is not doing the testing. And number two, at the hospital, they have so many other urgent diseases, malaria, for example, that Covid is just really the last thing on their list.Exactly. There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country. So I went back down south to Freetown, to the capital. And I went to see Dr. Austin Demby, who is the health minister of Sierra Leone. And I went into his office in the ministry.So I cover global health for The Times. And I am meant to travel the world, although, obviously, the last couple of years, that has not been a thing.And told him why I was in Sierra Leone.I would love to hear from you how it’s been going and what the challenges are.Yeah, so thank you very much. And by the way—And he told me about how he used to work for the C.D.C. in the United States. And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister.I was appointed on the 10th of February last year.And that was peak pandemic. So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point.

Models are useful to a point, but there are lots of other ways of seeing deaths, right?When Zambia had a bad Delta wave, there were bodies stacked outside the morgue. I mean, a place like Sierra Leone holds really, really big funerals. People say there’s just no way that there could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths and that we’ve just missed them.And Stephanie, if it were true that there were high case numbers, but low deaths from Covid in Sierra Leone, what would explain that?Well, that is an excellent question. So, again, there are lots of theories. The leading one— and I think that whatever else is true, this is a part of it— is age, right? Sub-Saharan Africa has a median age of 19, right? Sierra Leone is right around that as well. And that compares with 43 in Europe, 38 in the United States. And so we know that Covid is much more deadly for older people who have lived long enough to have developed the co-morbidities, such as diabetes, that makes Covid really deadly. The virus is far less likely to kill young people. And they’re often asymptomatic altogether.Another argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with temperature, the fact that it’s, obviously, really quite warm in all of these countries, and people mostly live their life outdoors. Obviously, if you’re talking about people who are in Sierra Leone, primarily subsistence farmers spending the day in their fields, they’re not getting exposed to Covid the way they would on a crowded subway train, although, of course, now we know that huge numbers of people actually have been infected. So that theory is a bit questionable.And then finally, the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid, or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone, you’ve had repeated bouts of malaria. You’ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease, that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid.Hmm. That’s interesting. And how do these three factors hold up when you compare Sierra Leone to another similar country that had a really bad time with Covid?Well, we can talk about India. India has reported half a million Covid deaths, but it’s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to 4 million people who’ve died of the virus. So India also has a young population, right? There, the median age is about 28. It’s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors. And there’s regions of India that have very high rates of infection with malaria. There are lots of other pathogens in circulation, so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things.So we know that those factors were not protective in India. On the other hand, India is a much more dense place. It’s much more connected. It has much better transportation. So it’s not a straight comparison to Sierra Leone, but it’s enough to suggest that those three things alone don’t cover it as an explanation.So it sounds like what India is showing us is that these factors you’re talking about, they’re all playing something of a role, but there’s not a single one of them that solves the mystery entirely.Yeah, that’s exactly right.So I’m wondering, Stephanie, in all the reporting you’ve done, how do you even begin to figure out what’s true? I mean, is it that Covid deaths in Africa are really being undercounted, or that Africans have this really unique immunity to Covid?Where I wound up is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. If you’re in a place like Sierra Leone that has incredibly high infant mortality— it has the highest maternal mortality in the world. Thousands of people die of malaria. There is all kinds of other infectious diseases that people are prey to. It is possible that Covid could cause a rise in the number of deaths that wouldn’t necessarily show up the way it would in a country with overall lower mortality figures.On the other hand, I believe people in Sierra Leone when they say to me, there have been no extra deaths in my village this year. One person died, two people died. It’s just like all the other years. Nothing unusual has happened here.Right.What I can also tell you is that I was able to sit down and read all of the serious research on the topic in a single morning. It’s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters, right? It matters for Sierra Leone, for sub-Saharan Africa, but it also matters to everybody else.What are the stakes, Stephanie? Why does it matter?Well, it matters for a couple of reasons. In terms of why it matters for the world, if there is something going on that means people really aren’t getting sick with Covid or aren’t dying from Covid at the same rate in West and Central Africa, in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, understanding where that protection, where that immunity is coming from, that could help us in lots of ways. It could help develop better treatments. It could help with another generation of vaccines.So it matters for protecting the world, but it also matters for sub-Saharan Africa, for Sierra Leone. There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate 70 percent of people. And Sierra Leone is scrambling to do that.Well, you have now a situation where COVAX came through. The World Bank came through with funding that allowed us to buy about $4 million worth of vaccines.When I spoke to the health minister, Dr. Demby, he was talking about how there’s a lot of resources coming into the country right now to do Covid vaccination. But—At the same time we have the Ebola vaccination going on, there was a polio outbreak. So all of this was going on at the same time. The same staff was doing all of this.That is an enormous challenge in a place like Sierra Leone with a health system that was already really struggling to respond to what people needed.And not only that, you had to raise awareness, bring people in, and vaccinate them.And then trying to convince young healthy people to get a shot for a disease that, as we’ve just been talking about, they really don’t think as a risk to them.It becomes a real burden when people are not sick.So it sounds like there’s this tension here, right? I mean, public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate 70 percent of Africa. But Dr. Demby is finding that that’s a really complicated thing to do, and especially complicated when it’s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country.I think there’s a growing— it started as a whisper and then a mutter, and now it’s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa makes sense, whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources.My responsibility is, how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid, but at the same time, be a resource for rebuilding health systems?I think all things being equal, Dr. Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn’t killing people now, the next variant might be deadly. But—The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long.He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system, he’s facing these trade-offs. I would say there are artificial trade-offs between addressing one disease or another. And so he’s in this position where he’s having to really ask himself, what should he do with the limited resources that he has?Stephanie, thank you.It’s a pleasure.We’ll be right back.Here’s what else you need to know today.On Wednesday, in response to atrocities in the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies moved to impose full sanctions against Russia’s largest financial institutions.The Biden administration, together with the European Union, imposed strict sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, which holds over a third of the country’s financial assets, and Alfa-Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks. The administration also announced that it would block access to U.S.-held financial assets for family members and close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Putin’s two adult daughters.And Pentagon officials said that Russia has withdrawn all of its troops from the territory around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Chernihiv, a major city in the north. Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago, but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self-proclaimed pullout could be a ruse. As many as 40,000 Russian troops have now left the territory and are rearming and resupplying before launching what Western officials believe will be a renewed focus on Ukraine’s east and south.Meanwhile, a video posted online and verified by The New York Times appears to show Ukrainian mistreatment of Russian prisoners. In the video, a Russian soldier can be seen with a jacket pulled over his head, gasping for air, before he is shot by a Ukrainian soldier. At least three other men believed to be Russian soldiers lay dead beside him, one with his hands tied behind his back.Today’s episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja, Rikki Novetsky and Rob Szypko, with help from Michael Symon Johnson.

But nations in the center and west of the continent appear to have been largely spared. Sierra Leone, for example, has reported a total of 7,700 cases and 125 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.What is behind these low case and death rates — and what does that tell us about the future of the pandemic?Stephanie Nolen, a global health reporter for The New York Times.The coronavirus was expected to devastate Africa, but higher-income and better-prepared countries appear to have fared far worse.There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily.

The three people who died had not been vaccinated against covid-19, according to NPR. The last reported covid-19 death in the city was April 8, 2020.Shanghai reported 22,248 new local infections on Monday, according to China’s National Health Commission, by far the worst outbreak in all of China right now. The vast majority of those infections were asymptomatic. Mainland China reported 1,104 new local infections outside of Shanghai on Monday.Residents of Shanghai have struggled with this most recent lockdown, which started in late March. Viral videos have emerged showing health workers beating residents for allegedly violating covid protocols and unconfirmed reports have even claimed pets of people who test positive have been killed.China’s government has pursued the controversial goal of completely eliminating covid-19 from the country, rather than allowing it to circulate through the country. And while the strategy has likely saved millions of lives since the start of the pandemic, it’s a draconian policy that has severely impeded people’s ability to move freely.The U.S. reported 8,099 new cases on Sunday, a vast undercount given that just four of the 50 states reported their numbers on the Easter holiday. The U.S. is currently averaging 36,698 new cases per day, a number that itself is likely artificially low due to the vast number of people who test positive with home testing and don’t report the results to their local health commission. The U.S. is averaging 447 new deaths from covid-19 each day.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.The U.S. has reported over 80.5 million covid-19 cases since the pandemic started in early 2020 and over 987,000 deaths.

But herd immunity looks likely to remain elusive, and many people are still at high risk from Covid-19.What do the C.D.C. figures mean for immunity in the United States, and for the future of the pandemic?Apoorva Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter for The New York Times.Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations.There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily.

The U.S. State Department ordered some workers to leave Shanghai.As U.S. cases tick up, the new White House Covid czar says it’s not a moment to be ‘excessively concerned.’The U.S. State Department orders nonemergency workers and their families to leave Shanghai.The city of Philadelphia will reinstate an indoor mask mandate, the first major U.S. city to do so this spring.Virus outbreaks are pushing some U.S. universities to reinstate mask mandates.The Boston Symphony cancels its European tour over virus concerns.‘We cannot let our guard down,’ a top Chinese health official tells people under lockdown.The new White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr. Ashish K. Jha, said Monday that while there had been a recent uptick in new U.S. coronavirus cases, he was not overly concerned.“We’ve got to watch this very carefully — obviously, I never like to see infections rising — I think we’ve got to be careful,” Dr. Jha said on the “Today” show. “But I don’t think this is a moment where we have to be excessively concerned.”Dr. Jha, a public health expert, made several media appearances on Monday, his first official day according to the White House, and he pointed to low hospitalization numbers across the United States. The vast majority of the country has low community levels of Covid-19, according to calculations performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are designed to assess the number of new cases in a community and the strain on its hospitals, a point also made on Sunday by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s top pandemic adviser.“Right now that is showing an uptick, but not showing substantial changes in what we should be doing,” Dr. Jha said on CNN, referring to the C.D.C. framework. “And I think the C.D.C. policy is right on this.”And while he praised the role of at-home tests, Dr. Jha acknowledged many of those results may go unreported, underpinning, he said, the importance of hospitalizations as a metric.Dr. Jha’s tenure begins as a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2, has become the dominant version among new U.S. cases. As of Sunday, the United States was averaging more than 31,000 cases a day, an increase of 3 percent over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database, just a fraction of the height of the Omicron winter surge.Still, New York City and Washington, D.C., are among the places seeing steeper increases than the nation overall, though their average numbers of new cases remain far lower than recent peaks, too. Prominent officials in both cities, such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mayor Eric Adams of New York, have tested positive in recent days, as have some Broadway stars.On Monday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said that both Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had tested negative in the last 24 hours. Ms. Harris had been considered a close contact of her communications director, who tested positive last week, but the vice president was now five days post-exposure, Ms. Psaki said.A handful of colleges and universities in the country have reinstated mask mandates as they battle outbreaks on campus. On Monday, the city of Philadelphia announced it would soon reinstate an indoor mask mandate.This chart shows how reported cases per capita have changed in different parts of the country. The state with the highest recent cases per capita is shown.And after the Gridiron Club and Foundation’s annual dinner in Washington on April 2, at least 80 attendees tested positive, Tom DeFrank, a contributing editor for National Journal and president of the Gridiron Club, said in an email on Monday afternoon. The number of new cases reported each day has been declining, he said, adding that reported symptoms remain mild, with several asymptomatic cases.“Now that we are nine days after the dinner, the connection between a new positive test and our dinner is certainly arguable, particularly for public officials who have had a full week of public events,” Mr. DeFrank said in a statement.“What it reminds us is the pandemic isn’t over,” Dr. Jha said on “Good Morning America,” referring to the number of cases after the Gridiron dinner, which included some Cabinet members. “We are still going to see cases of this virus spreading. And we have to continue to be vigilant. We have to continue to be careful.”Neither Mr. Biden nor Ms. Pelosi attended the Gridiron dinner, and Ms. Pelosi said on Monday that she would be leaving isolation on Tuesday after testing negative on Monday.Elsewhere in the House, Representative Rashida Tlaib said on Monday she had tested positive. In Connecticut, the lieutenant governor, Susan Bysiewicz, said she tested positive, too.Dr. Jha also told the “Today” show that the C.D.C. would get the final say on the future of the mask mandate on airplanes and other public transportation — but said that extending the requirement, which currently goes through at least April 18, “is absolutely on the table.”Dr. Jha replaced Jeffrey D. Zients, who left the position to return to his private life, according to the White House. Mr. Zients, an entrepreneur and management consultant, steered the White House response and U.S. vaccination campaign through multiple variants.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.— Giulia Heyward and Alexandra E. Petri The U.S. State Department said on Monday that it had ordered all nonemergency U.S. consulate employees and their families to leave Shanghai as a lockdown aimed at containing a surge in Omicron coronavirus cases stretched into its second week.China’s “zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19,” the travel advisory issued on Monday said, “severely impacts travel and access to public services.”The move came after the department had, on Friday, authorized those individuals to depart the area, adding that Americans should avoid traveling to China because of its “arbitrary enforcement of local laws and Covid-19 related restrictions.”“The movement from ‘authorized’ to ‘ordered’ departure means that we are now mandating that certain employees depart Shanghai rather than making this decision voluntary,” the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China said in a statement, adding that the employees and families will depart on commercial flights.“Our change in posture reflects our assessment that it is best for our employees and their families to be reduced in number and our operations to be scaled down,” the agency said.The American Citizen Services Unit, as the consular services office of the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai is known, has been closed since March 30, the agency said.Under a lockdown that began on April 1, residents of Shanghai, a city of 25 million people, have struggled to arrange food deliveries. Some residents have shouted out their windows, demanding to be given supplies. Shanghai recorded about 26,100 new symptomatic and asymptomatic cases on Sunday, China’s National Health Commission said on Monday, accounting for more than 94 percent of about 27,500 cases that the health authorities recorded throughout mainland China.The State Department has advised Americans not to travel to Hong Kong because of the restrictions imposed by the city under the direction of the central Chinese government, as the Chinese territory has struggled to contain the wave of cases there.In both Shanghai and Hong Kong, the department said, some children had been separated from their parents to be quarantined or isolated, although the Shanghai government has begun allowing children with special needs to quarantine with their families.The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, declined to say on Monday afternoon whether any American families had been separated by quarantine orders in Shanghai. Alexandra Stevenson and Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.— John Yoon With new coronavirus cases low but rising sharply in recent days, the city of Philadelphia announced on Monday that it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate a little more than a month after lifting it, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so.“This is our chance to get ahead of the pandemic,” said Cheryl Bettigole, the city’s health commissioner, in a news conference. She acknowledged that the average number of daily new cases, currently at 142, is still nowhere near what it was at the beginning of the year, when the Omicron variant was pushing the seven-day average to nearly 4,000.But she said that if the city failed to require masks now, “knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations, and then a wave of deaths, then it will be too late for many of our residents.” Over the past week, the city reported that the number of residents who had died of Covid-19 passed 5,000.The mandate will go into effect next week. A spokesman for the city’s health department said it would end when case numbers and rates go beneath a certain threshold.The decision comes as cases are ticking up across the country, fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2. While the national increase is so far relatively small — about 3 percent over the last two weeks — the growth in cases in Northeastern cities like New York City and Washington, D.C., has been significantly steeper. Some colleges in the Northeast, including Columbia, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, have reinstated indoor mask mandates in recent days.Speaking at a virtual news conference on Monday afternoon, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City said that he would follow the advice of his health team in making any determination on reinstating mask mandates in spite of his positive test result on Sunday, rising virus cases in the city and Philadelphia’s decision.“I am not special as being the mayor. What happens to me personally should not determine how I make policies,” Mr. Adams said. “It should be what happens to the City of New York.”“I feel fine, no fever, no running nose, no aches and pains,” the mayor said, adding that with his health history of diabetes, “I would probably have had different outcomes if I was not vaccinated and boosted.”Under Philadelphia’s Covid response plan, mitigation measures are triggered when caseloads or case trajectories pass certain thresholds. Since early March, as Omicron swiftly receded, the city had been at Level 1, or “all clear,” meaning most mandatory measures — including indoor mask mandates as well as proof-of-vaccine requirements in restaurants — had been lifted. Masks have no longer been required at city schools, though people visiting hospitals or riding public transportation still have had to wear them.The indoor mask mandate is reinstated automatically when the city rises to Level 2, in which average new daily case counts and hospitalizations are still low but “cases have increased by more than 50 percent in the previous 10 days.” The health departments spokesman said over the last 10 days case the average number of news cases had risen nearly 70 percent.Philadelphia’s system “allow us to be clear, transparent and predictable in our response to local Covid-19 conditions,” said Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement after the announcement was made. “I’m optimistic that this step will help us control the case rate,” he added.The city’s decision is at odds with the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Basing its designation on hospital admissions among other benchmarks, the C.D.C. considers Philadelphia to have a “low” community level, and thus does not advise required masking.Asked about the difference, Dr. Bettigole emphasized that “local conditions do matter” in making these decisions, and brought up the inequities in the virus’s impact. “We’ve all seen here in Philadelphia, how much our history of redlining, history of disparities has impacted, particularly our Black and brown communities in the city,” she said. “And so it does make sense to be more careful in Philadelphia, than, you know, perhaps in an affluent suburb.”Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.— Campbell Robertson A small number of U.S. colleges and universities are reinstating mask policies, citing coronavirus outbreaks on campus. The moves come at a time when the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2, has become the dominant version among new U.S. cases, which are ticking up.The nation was averaging more than 31,000 new coronavirus cases a day as of Sunday, according to a New York Times database —\\xa0 a 3 percent increase from two weeks ago. New York City and Washington, D.C., have seen sharper increases, though the figures there remain well below earlier peaks. Several prominent officials and some Broadway stars have recently tested positive. With new cases low but rising sharply in recent days, the city of Philadelphia announced on Monday that it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate a little more than a month after lifting it, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so.During the winter surge driven by another form of Omicron, the BA.1 subvariant, some universities shifted to pandemic policies aimed at living with the virus rather than trying to keep it off campus completely — policies like using quarantines and social distancing when outbreaks occur, rather than canceling in-person instruction altogether. As the numbers of new cases decreased, some colleges and universities further loosened precautions like surveillance testing programs, despite criticism from public health experts.Now, while some universities like Harvard are letting professors decide for themselves which rules to follow in their classrooms, others are imposing new campuswide mask rules:American University said on Monday that it would start requiring masks in all campus buildings, including medical facilities and the school’s shuttles, beginning on Tuesday. Professors will be able to remove their masks in classrooms while teaching.Columbia University said on Sunday that students would have to wear non-cloth masks in classrooms for the remainder of the spring semester, through May 2, “based on the current situation and in an abundance of caution.” Last week, Barnard College, a women’s undergraduate college affiliated with Columbia, reinstated its indoor mask rule.Georgetown University announced last week that masks would be required inside any campus buildings until further notice because of campus Covid outbreaks, “particularly among undergraduate students.”George Washington University said Monday that its mask mandate would return and stay in place through commencement, the school’s student newspaper reported. Officials quoted in the report cited the university’s seven-day positivity rate, which is nearing 2 percent after remaining close to 1 percent for much of the semester.Johns Hopkins University said last week that it would require masks indoors, along with twice-weekly testing of students, and noted that nearly 100 of its more than 5,000 undergraduate students had tested positive since April 1.Rice University reinstated its mask requirement for classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. Those who are unvaccinated must continue to wear a mask in other indoor areas as well.Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.— Giulia Heyward The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced on Monday that it was canceling a four-city tour of Europe because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States.The orchestra said the tour, which was to have included stops next month in Germany, Austria and France, was not feasible because of the potential for the virus to disrupt travel. The orchestra has recently reported a surge in cases among players and members of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.“Given the ongoing presence of Covid, brought home by its unfortunate impact on a significant number of our own artists, we must keep as our first priority the health and safety of everyone involved with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,” Gail Samuel, the orchestra’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. “Sadly, the only prudent and responsible course of action is, with deep regret, to cancel the European tour.”Many classical music ensembles hoped to resume global tours this year after the long hiatus brought by the pandemic. But the persistence of the Omicron variant has continued to complicate plans.The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra recently announced it was canceling a tour of Japan and South Korea in June because of concerns about the virus.Orchestra tours have been a staple of classical music going back decades, when the biggest ensembles in the United States and Europe began leading whistle-stop visits to global capitals. In those days, tours served not just artistic purposes but also commercial ends, giving orchestras exposure to new markets and, occasionally, lucrative sponsorships.Tours are no longer the moneymakers they used to be, except for a small number of elite ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic. But they bestow international prestige on orchestras — an attractive prospect for donors — and give ensembles an opportunity to build cohesion.Overseas trips came to a halt at the outset of the pandemic, when classical touring was one of the first industries to shut down. (At the end of January 2020, before the disruptions caused by the coronavirus were widely felt in the United States, the Boston Symphony announced that it was canceling a tour of Asia.)Other ensembles have plans to go overseas in the coming months. The New York Philharmonic is planning a residency at a festival in Usedom, Germany, next month. The Philadelphia Orchestra is planning a tour of Europe in late summer.— Javier C. Hernández To Shanghai residents who have reached the limit of their patience with a lockdown that has kept them stuck at home for two weeks, a top health official has a message: “We cannot let our guard down.”Despite reports that the shutdown of daily life in Shanghai has caused food shortages and reduced access to medical care, Liang Wannian, a senior official at China’s National Health Commission, said on Sunday that the lockdown was the best way to ensure “people first, lives first.”Under the country’s zero-Covid strategy, Shanghai and more than a dozen other cities in China are under full or partial lockdowns to tackle spikes in Omicron cases of the coronavirus. The lockdowns are exposing a growing social and economic cost of the strategy, which has been abandoned nearly everywhere else in the world.Other countries have lifted most restrictions, but “lying flat is not an option for China,” Mr. Liang said, referring to the phenomenon of “lying flat,” or relaxing, in the face of a challenge.China’s relatively low vaccination rate among older people and its limited health care resources for treating severe virus cases continue to worry officials and keep them from easing pandemic restrictions. There are around 264 million people over the age of 60 in China, and some 40 million of them have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus.Infections among this group were inevitable, Mr. Liang said, but “we have to take it seriously.” He spoke in an interview with Chinese state media.Health authorities reported 27,419 new locally transmitted cases in China on Monday, most of them in Shanghai, a city of 26 million. That case count is small compared with many countries, but the recent surge, fueled by the Omicron variant, is the biggest that China has experienced so far.China has reported more than 200,000 locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Shanghai since the current outbreak began last month, most of them mild or asymptomatic. The city has just one case that is currently categorized as “severe”; officials said the case required hospital treatment but did not elaborate. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak.Mass testing, a key part of China’s strategy to eliminate infections, has allowed health authorities to isolate patients who test positive and send them quickly to a hospital or isolation facility. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said last week that it would test all 18 million of its residents, after a small number of locally transmitted cases — fewer than 30 — were reported over the previous seven days. Officials in Shanghai announced a second round of mass testing for that city’s 25 million residents over the weekend.In the city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged, officials began on Monday to require residents wishing to use the city’s subway to have had a negative result on a nucleic acid test within the past 48 hours. Passengers must show their test result and scan a code from the specific subway car they sit in, so that authorities can keep track of exposure, according to a notice posted online by the Wuhan Metro on Monday.Though Mr. Liang indicated that China would not back down from its coronavirus strategy, authorities in Shanghai appeared to respond to a public outcry over the city’s handling of the outbreak. The vice mayor said on Saturday that the city would begin to lift lockdown measures in neighborhoods that go 14 days without a new case. On Monday, the city announced a system to categorize districts based on the number of reported positive cases in each.However, those moves will not do much to mitigate the lockdown’s larger economic impact, some economists said.“The extent of the lockdown is far more serious than people realize,” said Bo Zhuang, a China analyst at the investment firm Loomis Sayles.For most of last year, only a few cities in China were under lockdown at any one time, and the economic damage was manageable, Mr. Zhuang said. But these days, he estimated, the equivalent of around a quarter of China’s economic output is on hold.“Now we are talking about a couple of provinces under lockdown because of Omicron,” Mr. Zhuang said. “This would be a risk going forward.”The growing frustration over having daily life disrupted is another risk.When millions of people in Wuhan learned on Monday morning about the new rules imposed overnight concerning the city’s subway system, many turned to social media to complain.“Since Wuhan lifted the lockdown two years ago, it has issued the most stringent prevention and control measures,” Zhai Haichao, a writer and a businessman, wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. “It’s disturbing that we see no end of the pandemic.”— Alexandra Stevenson and Amy Chang Chien An experimental drug halved the death rate among critically ill Covid patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen and were at high risk for serious lung disease and death, the drug’s developer announced on Monday.There is a pressing need for new treatments for critically ill patients. Drugs like Paxlovid, made by Pfizer, are aimed primarily at patients who have mild or moderate disease. Other treatments administered to hospitalized patients in serious condition have shown limited effectiveness.The new drug, sabizabulin, reduced deaths among hospitalized Covid-19 patients so drastically in a clinical trial that independent safety monitors recommended stopping it early, officials at Veru Inc., the drug’s maker, said. The trial was halted on Friday.The results of that trial have not been reviewed by outside experts or published in a medical journal. Veru announced the findings at an early-morning news conference. The company’s stock soared in trading Monday following the announcement.About half of the 52 trial participants given a placebo or dummy pill along with regular care died within 60 days, an indicator of how very sick they were. But the death rate was 20 percent among the 98 participants who received sabizabulin, who were just as ill. The drug was given once a day for up to 21 days.“Sabizabulin is the first drug to demonstrate a clinically and statistically meaningful reduction in deaths in hospitalized patients,” Dr. Mitchell Steiner, chief executive of Veru, said. “This represents a big step forward.”Most Covid restrictions have been lifted in the United States after declining case numbers, but cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the world continue to be high, Dr. Steiner added. New variants are bound to emerge, and surges will follow.Close to a million Americans have died of Covid, and there are still 570 fatalities every day on average.The drug was granted so-called fast-track status by the Food and Drug Administration in January, Dr. Steiner said. The designation is intended to prompt faster development and review of new treatments that address unmet medical needs and target serious or life-threatening conditions.Dr. Steiner said the company plans to meet with the agency later this month and will be applying for emergency-use authorization for sabizabulin. An F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the agency did not confirm, deny or comment on pending applications.No safety concerns related to the drug were identified in the course of the clinical trial, company officials said.— Roni Caryn Rabin GLOBAL ROUNDUPSouth Korea is set to ease social distancing regulations this week as the number of new coronavirus cases falls, in line with a decline seen in many Asian countries with the notable exception of China.South Korea, which has a population of 52 million, saw a 29 percent decrease in new daily cases over the past week. It reported 90,928 new cases on Monday, the lowest level in nearly two months. As of Sunday, the average number of new cases was 203,313, a 41 percent decrease over the last two weeks, according to Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.The fall comes even as the authorities loosened some social distancing regulations last week, allowing businesses to open until midnight and increasing the cap on social gatherings to 10 from eight.The government is likely to take another step toward full reopening this week.“We will see by how much we can adjust social distancing regulations,” a senior health official, Son Young-rae, said at a briefing on Friday. Officials say the goal is to lift restrictions altogether, though it will still be obligatory to wear a mask indoors.South Korea received praise for its handling of the coronavirus in the early stages of the pandemic, but new cases soared to what at one point was a worldwide high of more than 600,000 per day in March, before starting to fall this month.Starting Monday, local health clinics and testing centers will no longer offer free rapid tests to the general public and will administer P.C.R. exams only to those in high-risk groups.The nation has a vaccination rate of 87 percent, while 64.2 percent of people have received a booster shot, according to government records. In all, 19,421 people have died from the virus in South Korea. China’s new daily case rate has risen by 340 percent in the last two weeks, while cases are up 5 percent in Japan over the same period.Elsewhere in the world:Spain’s science minister said on Monday that a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Hipra, a Spanish pharmaceutical company, could be put on sale as early as late May. The minister, Diana Morant, said in an interview with TV3, a television channel, that she expected the vaccine to receive a regulatory green light soon from the European Medicines Agency, and that the last stages of clinical trials had been “very good,” though she gave no details. Hipra developed the vaccine with the help of about €18 million from the Spanish government. The company has said it could produce 600 million doses by the end of the year.— Jin Yu Young and Raphael Minder Filed under:A Florida federal judge said the mask mandate was unlawfulA federal judge said Monday that the Biden administration could not require masks be worn on airplanes and public transportation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have the authority to introduce a mask mandate and did not follow the proper rules to implement a mandate, US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle wrote in the ruling. The mask mandate has been in place since January 2021. The CDC had just last week extended it through May 3rd. It had been set to expire on April 18th, the same day the judge made the ruling.Public transit was one of the last places masks were reliably required in the United States — most states and cities have dropped their mandates, although some have re-introduced mask-wearing rules indoors in the face of rising COVID-19 cases. The CDC said in February that masks were no longer needed on school buses.COVID-19 cases are ticking up across the country as highly contagious versions of the Omicron variant take over as the predominant form of the virus in circulation. The Transportation Security Administration won’t enforce mask wearing on public transportation, CNBC reports citing an unnamed administration official. The White House press secretary said the administration was still reviewing the order and the Justice Department will decide whether to appeal.

By 2070, if global temperatures continue to rise as predicted, there could be a total of 15,000 new cross-species “viral sharing events,” according to new research published today in the journal Nature. Of the at least 10,000 virus species in mammals capable of infecting humans, most are still only circulating among animals in the wild. The worry is that more of those viruses could eventually make the leap to humans, potentially sparking a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.“Ultimately, this work provides us with more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter but sicker,” Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University and co-lead author of the study, said in a call with reporters. As global temperatures rise, many species might need to migrate because the climate they’re used to living in is changing. Others might find that places that were once inhospitable — maybe they were too cold — are becoming more enticing. As they travel, they bring pathogens with them. Essentially, viruses now have more hosts with whom they can hitchhike long distances. That allows viruses to reach places and species that they otherwise wouldn’t have had access to in the past. “Even now, this process has likely been taking place, mostly unobserved and below the surface, and we need to start looking for it,” Albery said.When a virus passes from one species to another, it’s called a “spillover” event. If spillover occurs between an animal and a human being, a zoonotic disease can emerge. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it can move between humans and other animals. There’s evidence the novel coronavirus originated in bats. But it probably jumped to at least one other animal before reaching humans.The authors of the new study looked at potential changes to the geographical ranges of over 3,000 mammal species in a warming world. They also took into consideration how land use might change, say from deforestation and urban development. There could be over 300,000 “first encounters” between different kinds of animals in a future with two degrees of global warming above pre-industrial levels, the research shows. Most of those encounters would probably take place in tropical Asia and Africa. And that could lead to 15,000 transmission events in which at least one novel virus moves from one species to another. A majority of the projected viral sharing involves bats, which are unique among mammals because they can fly from continent to continent. The researchers stop short of estimating how often viruses might then hop over to humans. And not every virus that finds its way from an animal to a human triggers an epidemic. But Albery noted on the press call that when a virus jumps to a new species, it can create conditions that might help the virus evolve into one that’s “particularly well suited or well placed to make the jump into humans.” Take raccoons, which can thrive in forests, marshes, suburbs, and city centers. If those resourceful raccoons suddenly become susceptible to a new virus, they might be much more able to bring that virus into places where humans live. And since the virus has already made one leap from another kind of animal to a raccoon, then the virus has demonstrated that it’s prone to jumping between species.The new paper suggests that these trends are already underway and will be a problem even under some of the best-case scenarios for future climate change. We’re well on our way toward surpassing that two-degree threshold; the world has already warmed by over one degree. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged shortly after this research was completed, which the authors say points to the urgent need to prepare for more spillover. “We have to take that seriously as a real-time threat,” Georgetown University biologist Colin Carlson, another lead author of the study, said on the call. “We have to acknowledge that climate change is going to be the biggest upstream driver of disease emergence. And we have to build health systems that are ready for that.”That includes pairing surveillance of new viruses with observations of how species’ geographic ranges are shifting, the authors say. It’s part of a bigger movement to adopt a concept called One Health, which acknowledges that the health of animals, people, and the environment are all connected.Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.Chinese authorities have extended their lockdown of Shanghai to cover all its 25 million people after a fresh surge in Covid cases.Initially, there had been separate measures for the eastern and western sides, but the whole city is now subject to indefinite restrictions.Shanghai is the largest single city to be locked down to date.The important financial hub has battled a new wave of coronavirus infections for more than a month.Reported cases have risen to more than 13,000 a day, although the numbers are not high by some international standards. Residents in some areas of the city said the strict policy meant no-one was allowed to leave their housing compounds, not even to collect essential provisions.They reported difficulties in ordering food and water online, with restrictions on when customers are able to place their orders, because of a shortage of supplies and delivery staff.This country\\'s \"zero-Covid\" system is, at best, struggling to cope.China has done Covid lockdowns before, but not on the scale of its financial mega-city.The logistical challenges required to confine 25 million people to their homes, while keeping them fed, are huge. Social media here is full of angry residents complaining that they can\\'t order food because the delivery system is clogged up.Centralised isolation facilities - many using only camp beds, with no showers or other facilities - are bursting with infected people squashed in next to one another.One of China\\'s few reliable media outlets, Caixin, has reported that close contacts of infected people will be moved to neighbouring provinces. This could potentially involve hundreds of thousands of Shanghai residents.The Chinese government\\'s complete elimination strategy has become something of a mantra, with the government ridiculing other countries for sacrificing their own people on the altar of opening up.Some medical specialists here have tried to get the message through that, for a vaccinated person, catching the Omicron variant of Covid will probably not necessitate going to hospital - that you can simply ride it out at home until you recover.Few people in China seem to be aware of this. Their officials and state media have kept it from them.So the lockdowns continue and it\\'s not only Shanghai closed right now. Jilin City (3.6 million people), Changchun (nine million), Xuzhou (nine million), the steel city of Tangshan (7.7 million) and various other towns and villages are keeping their residents indoors.The strain on people, and the economic cost of it all, must be enormous.The city is testing the limits of China\\'s zero-Covid strategy, amid growing public anger over quarantine rules.The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run. \"Currently, Shanghai\\'s epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,\" said Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission. \"We must adhere to the general policy of dynamic clearance without hesitation, without wavering.\"On Monday, Shanghai reported a record 13,086 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, after a city-wide testing programme took samples from more than 25 million people in 24 hours.At least 38,000 people have been deployed to Shanghai from other regions, in what state media have said is the biggest nationwide medical operation since the shutdown of Wuhan in early 2020.Why China is locking down its citiesChina announces Shanghai lockdownOmicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?The economic cost of China\\'s zero-Covid policyRussia forced to merge depleted units in eastern Ukraine - UKUS accuses Russia of depravity and brutalityVenus and Jupiter to almost touch in night skyUkraine - the narrative the West doesn\\'t hearTaking missiles out of suburban living rooms.

The study found that long covid patients taking part in a rehabilitation program in Ireland, conducted online, experienced noticeable improvements in how their fatigue affected their well-being and daily functioning.There is much that we’re still unsure about when it comes to long covid, from its likely causes to how often it happens (estimates range from the single digits to over 25% of covid-19 cases). And we know even less about the best ways to help sufferers recover from it.There are dedicated long covid clinics in the U.S. and elsewhere, where patients might be given treatments like physical therapy, counseling, and medications to manage other conditions that could have arisen as a result, such as hypertension or diabetes. But information is sparse on how effective any of these interventions are at improving people’s symptoms or their overall quality of life. The new research, presented this week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, provides some preliminary data to that end.The pilot study included 53 people who reported covid-related fatigue severe enough to impact their daily life. About two-thirds had been dealing with their symptoms at least 12 weeks to a year after their initial covid diagnosis, while a third had been experiencing them for over a year. Nearly three-fourths also reported breathing difficulties, and about half were experiencing cognitive dysfunction, often known as brain fog.The rehab program they took part in was developed by occupational therapists at St James’s Hospital and Trinity College in Ireland and was adapted from interventions they’ve previously used to help patients with multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions. It involved three 90-minute sessions with an occupational therapist over a four-week period, delivered online at the time due to pandemic precautions. These sessions focused on stress management, sleep hygiene, and training people to recognize the daily limits of their physical and mental energy before their symptoms worsen.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.Before and after the program, patients were asked via survey about their levels of fatigue, well-being, and quality of life. By the end of the program, patients generally reported improvements in how they felt and in how their symptoms affected their lives.“Initial results from our pilot program are highly promising,” senior study author Louise Norris, an occupational therapist at St James’s Hospital in a statement from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. “They show equipping patients with a range of practical techniques can result in meaningful improvements in fatigue and quality of life. Patients also have fewer concerns about their wellbeing.”These results do come from a small sample size and have yet to be peer-reviewed, so they should be taken with added caution. The intervention also isn’t necessarily addressing the root cause of the symptoms, which may include persistent infection or an autoimmune dysfunction caused by the original infection. But it may help restore people’s ability to lead a functional life while dealing with their illness, the researchers note. And with the promising results from their pilot study now in hand, they’ve already begun to collect additional data from more patients—data that might someday show that these kinds of programs can be widely used to help patients find some semblance of normalcy again.“There is an urgent need to find new and better ways of managing post-covid fatigue and its wide-ranging, and in some cases, devastating, effects on people’s lives,” said Norris.

Now, they look like 20/20 foresight.A curbside reading room outside the Crown Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.Credit...Gregg RichardsSupported bySend any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Karrie JacobsThis article is part of our latest Design special report, about new creative pathways shaped by the pandemic.As the first winter of the pandemic drew to a close, someone in my Twitter feed enthused about an app called Libby that made it especially easy to borrow and read library books. I downloaded it, input my New York Public Library card number and proceeded to binge. I devoured everything by and about Isaac Babel, who wrote stories based on his life in early-20th-century Odessa, and all of Mick Herron’s Slough House books, about a group of sad, incompetent British spies.Libby was created by OverDrive, a Cleveland-based company that digitizes books and other publications and distributes them to 90 percent of North American libraries. The app debuted in 2017 but, no surprise, had its biggest bump in growth in 2020, a 33 percent increase in circulation compared with 2019. What distinguishes Libby from other library apps, like the New York Public Library’s SimplyE, is that it allows you to read on a Kindle (instead of, say, your phone). And it has a definite style, minimalist and sweet.Libby suggests, intentionally or not, that public libraries, the actual buildings, are no longer necessary, that libraries have become — like everything and everyone else — place-less purveyors of content. But if during the past couple of years you replaced in-person library visits with an app, you may be missing out. What many public libraries have done, despite Covid and because of it, is consciously enhance their physical presence on the street and in the neighborhood.My own heightened appreciation of the non-virtual library began one chilly evening last October. I attended a performance of excerpts from a new opera called “A Marvelous Order,” about the critic Jane Jacobs and her urban planning nemesis, Robert Moses, in essence, an opera about the value of public space. Appropriately, it was staged on the broad steps and fan-shaped plaza in front of Brooklyn’s Art Deco-style Central Library, with the composer, Judd Greenstein, conducting a small ensemble of musicians and singers and with animated graphics by Joshua Frankel projected on either side of the library’s ornate front entrance.The plaza in front of the Central Library is probably the best outdoor space in Brooklyn’s library system (which is separate from the New York Public Library system). Most of Brooklyn’s 61 libraries, including its Carnegie buildings, dating from the early 20th century, lack any kind of useful, accessible exterior space. Or so it seemed.But in January 2020, the library’s chief strategy officer, David Giles, working with a team that included Annie Barrett of BAS Architecture, embarked on a meticulous study called “Activating Exteriors,” to forge, in Ms. Barrett’s words, a “connection between a civic institution and its neighborhood.” The idea, initially, was to find ways to remove fences and other obstructions that rendered the libraries’ grounds inaccessible to the public.A few months after Covid hit, the long-term project was transformed into what Ms. Barrett called a “deployable strategy.” Said Mr. Giles, “We pushed into tactical mode.”The library decided it had to move at least some of its services outdoors. Even though the libraries were closed, the Wi-Fi was left on and, over time, the Brooklyn Public Library installed signal-boosting antennas atop most branches so that New Yorkers who lack home internet connections could have access to the web from outside. Then, at 30 or so branches, they positioned groups of cafe tables and chairs, plus the occasional book cart, wherever they would fit, on sidewalks or on narrow strips of grass.But the boldest move was the invention of the “Roadway Reading Room,” designed by Ms. Barrett and her firm, and based on the city Department of Transportation’s standards for restaurant “streeteries.” These little structures were intended to embody the gravitas associated with public libraries and also a whiff of grandeur. “We weren’t going to do things like string party lights across the sidewalk,” Ms. Barrett recalled.The elemental sheds, with distinctive, barrel-vaulted roofs, were fabricated by Bednark Studio, a firm at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, painted an eye-catching electric blue and deposited curbside in front of the Kensington, Crown Heights and Walt Whitman (Fort Greene) branches. According to Mr. Giles, the outdoor seating attracted both regular library patrons and random people looking for a spot to rest. Occasionally, police officers would use the tables to eat lunch, and, he told me, “in Brighton Beach, people would play chess.”The outdoor reading rooms were a bit neglected by the time I visited Walt Whitman in February; the chairs and tables had been removed and the structure was hemmed in by illegally parked cars. But the idea they represent — reinvention of the public library as a free-form community hub — continues to evolve. And, as it happens, this evolution is what positioned some libraries to function especially well during the pandemic.The new Greenpoint Library and Environmental Education Center, for example, funded in part by a $5 million grant from the settlement for ExxonMobil’s massive Newtown Creek oil spill, was conceived as a disseminator of environmental awareness and knowledge. When it first opened in September 2020, it could offer books only on a “grab and go” basis. But the design for its environmental mission, by the architecture firm Marble Fairbanks and landscape architecture firm SCAPE, provided an unusual amount of outdoor space, including a rooftop “reading garden” (with bleachers for the readers and shrubbery for the birds) and a second rooftop lined with planters where community members could learn to cultivate vegetables and flowers.“From the beginning we were investigating all the different ways that outdoor space would be used by the community,” said the architect Karen Fairbanks. The rooftop spaces have been well used over the past year and a half for events including evening stargazing and workshops on subjects like technology for teens and sewing.That the roof deck became a public library status symbol during a period when we could only safely gather outdoors is a happy accident. In Washington, D.C., for instance, the Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo included a spacious roof garden in its renovation plans for the central branch of the city’s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, a hard-edge 1972 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe building. Those plans were completed in 2016. The rooftop terrace, however, with its verdant landscape of wild grasses and flowers, made its public debut in September 2020. “It’s been by far the best used part of the building,” said Richard Reyes-Gavilan, executive director of the city’s libraries.The King roof deck is, at once, a place to temporarily escape the constraints of the virus and evidence of an underlying trend, Mr. Reyes-Gavilan said. “Libraries have been trying to figure out ways to make their buildings less transactional. We want people to come and stay for long periods of time to see the library as their co-working space or their third place.”Mecanoo (working with New York’s Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners) also included a roof deck in its redesign of the long-neglected Mid-Manhattan Library, now renamed (for the project’s biggest donor) the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library. On my first visit, on a warm autumn afternoon, I was astonished by the generosity of the concept: It is a public rooftop in the middle of Manhattan where you can sit quietly and read, or drink coffee (there’s a branch of Amy’s Bread), for as long as you’d like.“I would like to say that we were brilliant and foresaw Covid,” Iris Weinshall, the New York Public Library’s chief operating officer, told me. Instead the roof deck emerged from community gatherings where attendees argued for more and better meeting and event space.Mecanoo’s founding partner and creative director, Francine Houben, was offended by the American habit of wasting precious roof space on noisy HVAC systems. The architect worked with her team to devise an oddly shaped container in copper-patina green, known as the “wizard’s hat,” to hide and muffle all the machinery, thereby liberating the roof “for the people.”Of course, all of these efforts to expand the reach of the public library have been relatively modest. Elsewhere in the world, the notion that libraries are synonymous with openness has inspired bolder gestures.The most spectacular (and, arguably, most conflicted) example may be the reading room of the Beijing Sub-Center Library designed by the Norwegian firm Snohetta. Currently under construction, this indoor space encompasses more than four acres of undulating, glass-enclosed terrain supported by columns that the architects liken to ginkgo trees. Picture Zion National Park, but with tiers of bleachers rather than rock formations. “It’s really designed to be a piece of nature,” observed Snohetta’s partner, Robert Greenwood. “It’s just so big that it feels like you are out in a valley; you’re on a hillside.”As Mr. Reyes-Gavilan put it about the King Memorial Library roof deck, “When I’m up there on a warm day like today, people are so thankful that such a space exists.” Or, as Ms. Houben, who argues that every library needs a garden, suggested, “A library should be so nice that you bring your own book, right?”Karrie Jacobs is a New York-based writer specializing in architecture, design and urbanism.AdvertisementThe move is aimed at giving the C.D.C. the option of reinstating the mask mandate, if needed, after a federal judge struck down the requirement.The Biden administration says it may appeal a ruling that voided a mask mandate on public transport.Biden says Americans should decide for themselves if they want to wear masks on public transportation.Health experts express alarm at the ruling striking down the mask mandate on U.S. public transit.Experts are anxious as mask mandates fall.Masks stay required for N.Y.C. public transit, taxis and ride-share vehicles.Masks come off, to the cheers of some and concern of others.Several large U.S. transit systems have removed mask mandates.Nervous about flying? Here’s why a mask will still help protect you even if others aren’t wearing one.The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it intended to appeal a Florida judge’s ruling that struck down a federal mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation — but only if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary.The announcement from the Department of Justice came after a day of back and forth inside the White House, as administration officials faced a legal and political quandary: whether to let the judge’s ruling stand or to fight it, knowing that an appeal could result in a higher court, perhaps the Supreme Court, ruling against the administration and setting a lasting precedent that could undercut the C.D.C.’s authority.In the end, the administration charted a careful course, publicly objecting to Monday’s ruling but putting off a final decision about whether to contest it. The Justice Department and the C.D.C. “disagree with the district court’s decision and will appeal, subject to C.D.C.’s conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health,” the department said in a statement.“You are in the position of having two horrible choices,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University. “One choice is to risk forever taking away C.D.C.’s powers if this goes up to the 11th Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court.“And on the other hand,” he added, “if you let what I consider to be a lawless decision by this judge go forward, then C.D.C. is going to be gun-shy about doing things that it deems effective for the protection of the American public.”The mask mandate — which also applied to transportation hubs like airports and train stations, and even to ride-sharing services like Uber — had been set to expire on May 3 even before the judge struck it down on Monday.If the C.D.C. decides there is a public health basis for trying to reinstate and extend the mandate, the Justice Department will swiftly file an appeal. But if the C.D.C. decides otherwise, the administration will not appeal and the case will instead end as mooted — but without any signal of executive branch acquiescence to the judge’s view of its authority.The Justice Department “continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given C.D.C. to protect the public health,” its statement said. “That is an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve.”— Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — President Biden said on Tuesday that Americans should decide for themselves whether to wear masks, undercutting efforts by his administration to urge Americans to keep wearing face coverings on airplanes, trains and buses even after a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on public transport.The decision to wear a mask is “up to them,” Mr. Biden told reporters during a trip to New Hampshire to promote infrastructure spending.The Biden administration intends to appeal the ruling, if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary.The patchwork of messaging contributed to confusion less than 24 hours after the ruling was handed down. The president, caught somewhere between politics and science, left it up to Americans to make their own choices. His press secretary urged Americans to follow existing health guidance, because that is what the president would be doing. And Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, said on Twitter that he was disappointed in the ruling and that he, for one, would still wear masks on planes.A wave of federal agencies, city transit authorities and private companies said that they would no longer require travelers to wear masks after a federal judge appointed by former President Donald J. Trump voided a mandate on Monday that had been in place since February of last year. Just days earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended the mandate through May 3 to assess the state of the pandemic.The ruling took officials inside the White House by surprise and frustrated them, two senior officials said. But on Tuesday, as travelers aboard airplanes took directions from pilots to unmask and riders aboard transit systems, including in Washington, went mask-free, the Biden administration did not lay out a detailed plan to contest the ruling, even as public health experts warned that the C.D.C.’s authority to prevent the spread of a contagious virus was on the line.On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the decision to remove the masking decision should have been up to the C.D.C., not the courts.“Public health decisions shouldn’t be made by the courts, they should be made by public health experts,” Ms. Psaki told reporters on board Air Force One, on the way to New Hampshire. “We obviously feel confident in our authorities here given that we put the mask mandate in place and asked for 15 additional days to evaluate data based on public health information.”But the administration’s confidence in its ability to enforce masking requirements conflicted with the broader reality that many masking regulations seemed to dissolve within hours of the ruling. (Some, including in New York City, are staying in place.) The Transportation Security Administration said on Monday that it would stop enforcing the C.D.C. mandate. Several airlines, including Delta and United, told travelers that masks would not be required; some travelers learned the news midflight.Some White House officials said they would try to combat an inaccurate assessment of the threat the virus poses to the public. After Delta told its passengers that the virus had “transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus,” Kevin Munoz, a White House spokesman, tweeted that the virus was still a threat.Beyond piecemeal responses, Mr. Biden’s advisers have been trying to triage the effects of the ruling, agency by agency, to figure out what the response should be, one official said.Dr. Julie Morita, the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who served on Mr. Biden’s coronavirus advisory committee during his presidential transition, said that she hoped that the Biden administration would appeal the ruling.“It really is undermining of the C.D.C.’s public health authority to make requirements that really helps prevent disease transmission between states and internationally,” Dr. Morita said in an interview. The agency, she said, needs to “have the authority to implement these protective measures.”— Katie Rogers Many public health experts reacted with alarm to a ruling by a federal judge in Florida on Monday striking down a requirement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that passengers wear masks on buses, trains and planes.The ruling, which came less than a week after the C.D.C. had extended its order through May 3 and in the midst of a school vacation travel week, would curtail the ability of public health authorities to respond to the pandemic even as the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases rises again in the United States.Videos posted on Twitter showed air passengers flinging off their masks mid-flight and cheering after hearing announcements that the mandate had been scrapped. Some parents traveling with children too young to have been vaccinated expressed panic.Brooke Tansley, a television producer and former Broadway performer, was on a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles with her two children, a 4-year-old and an 8-month-old, when the pilot announced that masks were no longer required. “I was scared — all I could do was hope it’s going to be OK,” she said. “There wasn’t any other option.”Dr. Lakshmi Ganapathi, who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, pointed out that the ruling coincided with a recent rise in cases. “I think it’s extremely shortsighted and, if I were impolite, would say kind of stupid,” she said. “This ruling is ill-timed, and it’s not commensurate with public health principles.”She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups, including low-income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation, make them susceptible to infection, and that there is still no vaccine for very young children. Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations as protection may be overly optimistic as new variants emerge, Dr. Ganapathi said.On Jan. 29, 2021, the C.D.C. issued an order requiring people to wear masks while taking indoor public transportation and while in transportation hubs. In a statement released Tuesday, the agency said that as a result of Monday’s court ruling, the order was no longer in effect and would not be enforced, although the agency “continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time.”But even experts who had previously spoken out in favor of lifting the government mask mandate for passengers said they were troubled by the precedent that the federal judge’s ruling could set.Dr. Robert Wachter, who chairs the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and has recently said it is time to lift mask requirements, said the government needed to have the authority to issue mandates during public health crises. He called on the Biden administration to challenge the ruling.“If this becomes a precedent, that a judge can overrule government and C.D.C. experts, that puts us in a problematic place for the next surge, the next pandemic, bioterrorism or who knows,” Dr. Wachter said. “Government needs to be able to act, and to imply government does not have that authority is deeply concerning.”He noted that he would continue to wear a mask on flights and strongly encouraged his family and loved ones to do so, although he did not think the situation was sufficiently dire to justify a government mandate.“Should you wear a mask when you’re in an aluminum tube shoulder to shoulder with people for six hours?” Dr. Wachter said. “I think you should, and I will.”The same argument applied on trains and buses, he said: “My general feeling is that there is still enough virus around that I think it’s prudent to wear a mask in tight indoor spaces when you’re not sure of the vaccine status of the people around you and there’s a fair amount of virus in the community.”Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist who expressed concerns about lifting the mandate, said on Twitter on Tuesday that when it comes to air travel, “removing masking requirements is a great way to ensure you’re spreading Covid among a lot of people going to a lot of different regions.”Victoria Kim contributed reporting.— Roni Caryn Rabin Public health experts reacted with dismay to a federal judge’s ruling on Monday that struck down a mask requirement for plane, bus and train passengers, expressing concern that the case would set a precedent that erodes the authority of public health agencies and hampers their ability to respond to health emergencies.The Florida judge’s ruling was issued less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control had extended its mask order through May 3. The ruling also came in the middle of a school vacation that coincides with several major religious holidays, when many families are traveling to see relatives, some for the first time in two years.Many airplane passengers flung their masks off and cheered when pilots made announcements saying that the rule was no longer in effect. Others who have disabilities, are immunocompromised or were traveling with children too young to be vaccinated were caught off-guard and distressed that the rules were changed literally mid-flight.“If this ruling stands, it could put the American public at great risk,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president and chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the C.D.C. He added that his concerns were less to do with the immediate consequences for mask mandates than with “the implications for future crises, of the ability to put in place simple public health measures to keep people safe.”Dr. Lakshmi Ganapathi, who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, pointed out that the ruling coincides with a recent rise in Covid cases nationally, driven by a rise in cases on the East Coast.She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups, including low-income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation, make them susceptible to infection, and there is still no vaccine for very young children. Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations for protection may be overly optimistic, as emerging new variants could evade immunity, she said.Moreover, the widespread use of home testing kits, the results of which go unreported, means that official case counts do not reflect the true number of new cases. A rise in hospitalizations is not a reliable or timely indicator of severity either, Dr. Ganapathi said, since hospitalizations rise several weeks after cases begin to increase. “Once hospitalizations start rising, it’s baked in — you haven’t done anything to stop it,” she said. “And a proportion of those hospitalized will die.”— Roni Caryn Rabin Riders are still required to wear masks while taking public transportation in New York City, despite a federal judge in Florida’s ruling on Monday to overturn the nationwide mask mandate on planes and public transit.Major airlines across the country immediately dropped their mask requirements after the decision, moving so quickly that in some cases, masks became optional mid-flight.But as new confirmed coronavirus cases spurred by the rise of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA.2 rise around the country, leaders of New York City’s public transit network, citing public health guidance from the state, are keeping mask requirements in place.Tim Minton, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates New York’s subway, bus and commuter-rail networks, confirmed on Monday evening the mandate would remain in effect.He pointed to a March 2 decision by the New York state health commissioner laying out the protections mask-wearing offers from transmitting the virus, especially on public transportation.The M.T.A. falls under state control, and Gov. Kathy Hochul voiced her support for keeping the mandate on Tuesday, while also emphasizing the importance of vaccinations and regular testing.“Do your part to keep your neighbors safe,” she wrote on Twitter.The city’s Taxi & Limousine Commission, which oversees taxis and for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts, said on Tuesday that drivers and riders in those vehicles would continue to be required to wear masks as well.Uber had said on Tuesday that it would stop requiring masks in the United States. Lyft followed with a similar announcement, but both companies said local regulations would supersede their own rules.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major airports in the New York metropolitan area as well as interstate buses and bus terminals, said it would follow the local guidance in each state. Mask mandates remain in effect on the interstate PATH system and in two of the area’s three airports, Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia, which are both in New York City.But in neighboring New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy ended the mask mandate for New Jersey Transit and facilities operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority, including the Atlantic City International Airport. Masks will also no longer be required at Newark Liberty International Airport, the third major airport operated by the Port Authority, or at airports in Connecticut.Several health experts urged caution about rolling back mask mandates on public transport. Dr. Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne disease transmission, said although the city’s subway system has good air filtration and ventilation systems, those tools are no match for crowded buses or trains packed shoulder-to-shoulder with riders.— Ashley Wong and Ana Ley In the wake of a judge’s ruling on Monday that struck down a federal mandate, it is now up to each individual to decide whether to wear a mask on most commercial flights in the United States.Some people were glad to say good riddance to an inconvenience that they thought did little good and was no longer necessary. But quite a few said in interviews on Tuesday that they would stick with masks for now, even though they no longer had to.Candice Bailey, 51, was one of the holdouts. “Just to protect myself and to protect others, I continue to wear a mask,” Ms. Bailey said Tuesday morning at the airport in New Orleans as she waited to board a flight home to Greensboro, N.C. She said it was much too soon to know whether it was safe to set masks aside, especially “with the new variants that keep popping up.”With most travelers at the airport exposing their faces, Rachel Gordon, a 29-year-old science writer from Cambridge, Mass., acknowledged that she was bucking the trend. “I tend to be an outlier, because I do favor more conservative masking rules than my peers,” she said.Ms. Gordon said that she did so out of empathy for vulnerable people. When side effects from her second dose of vaccine “completely immobilized” her for a time, she said, “that gave me insight into what it might be like to get Covid without it.”Count Lois Strickland, 52, a track and field coach from Smithsburg, Md., among those who were glad to see the mandate go.“I’m tired of it, OK?” she said as she waited to board a flight to Washington. “I’ve already had Covid. I’ve already been vaccinated. I’m over it.”She noted that masks were no longer being required at many concerts and sporting events: “You don’t have to wear them there, why do we need them on public transportation?”The end of the mandate was a welcome relief for Carlos Perales, 31, a Chicago man who flew home from Florida on Tuesday with his wife, Yuliana, and two young daughters, aged 3 and 4.“It’s hard to travel with young kids and make them keep it on,” Mr. Perales said. And Abi Miller of South Bend, Ind., expressed hope that dropping the mandate would reduce the number of angry confrontations and fights on airplanes, which grew more common during the pandemic. “I figured I wouldn’t have to have my phone ready to record an incident,” she said.Samuel Oluwafemi said he found out about the end of the mandate when he landed at Salt Lake City Monday night on the first leg of his trip home to Atlanta from Honolulu. He skipped the mask for the second leg, but then put it on again as the plane neared the airport because he thought it might still be required on the ground and in the Uber car he would take home (it wasn’t).“Honestly, even now that I know, I’ll probably still wear a mask in the Uber, just to be safe,” he said. “I’m just used to it now.”Peter Shankman, 49, saw more value in mask-wearing than just Covid safety. He travels frequently for his job as a corporate keynote speaker, and he said that since he began wearing a mask on flights, he has been getting sick far less frequently.“I might continue it,” he said, adding, “It’s a little piece of fabric; it’s not that inconvenient.”For some travelers, the issue was complicated. Geoff Grubb, 44, a customer review specialist, wasn’t wearing a mask during a layover in New Orleans Tuesday, but he said he never minded wearing one.He said his 82-year-old father did mind, and had enough trouble breathing with a mask on that he avoided places that required them.Mr. Grubb said he wore a mask as he went through security at the Austin airport, but took it off at the gate where people were more spread out. If someone had asked him to, he said, he would have put it back on without complaint.“I don’t see anything in the Constitution that we have a right not to wear a mask,” he said.— Elisabeth Goodridge,\\xa0Tariro Mzezewa,\\xa0Heather Murphy,\\xa0Robert Chiarito and Patrick J. Lyons As major U.S. airlines dropped their mask mandates in response to a federal judge’s ruling, public transit systems across the country scrambled to adapt on Tuesday. New York, San Francisco and Milwaukee kept requirements in place, while systems in Atlanta, Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia allowed riders to drop their masks, as did the nationwide Amtrak rail system.In Philadelphia, the decision led to an odd juxtaposition: The city last week reinstated its mask mandate for indoor public spaces, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so this spring. But a statement late Monday announced an end to the requirement on city trains and buses, and in stations and concourses.Officials with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, wrestled with a response to the judge’s ruling. “It was a bit of a scramble,” said Andrew Busch, the Philadelphia agency’s spokesman. The overriding concern was that keeping the mask requirement would create challenges for employees charged with enforcing it, who have already faced pushback and harassment.“We wanted to try to reassure our employees that they wouldn’t be in a difficult position of trying to figure out how to tell people that this was required, when the mechanism for requiring it was no longer in place,” Mr. Busch said.Transit agencies in several other cities lifted their mandates on Tuesday, including on the Los Angeles Metro Bus and Rail system.In Boston, less than a day after the local transit agency said masks were still required on subways and buses, officials announced a reversal. Mask mandates were also lifted at Boston Logan International Airport and at most regional transit authorities across Massachusetts.After the Illinois governor amended a state mask mandate, both the Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago’s commuter rail system, Metra, announced that masks would no longer be required.Mask mandates were retained in some cities, however, including Portland’s TriMet agency and the operator of San Francisco’s city bus system and Bay Area Rapid Transit.The patchwork of responses underscored the uncertainty of the current phase of the pandemic. The Omicron subvariant known as BA.2 has reversed a nationwide decline in new cases — a trend that can be seen even with diminishing test data. But the virus is spreading in a country that is better vaccinated than during previous surges, and so far, an increase in hospitalizations has not followed the rise in infections.Even in places that have kept mask requirements, enforcement has long been virtually nonexistent on trains and buses. In Atlanta, where a mandate was in place until Tuesday, Aida Smith, 22, said that she had stopped masking on public transit after she was vaccinated against the coronavirus last year.“I feel like a lot of other people here did the same thing — got vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask,” she said.Darren Kettle, the chief executive of Metrolink, a commuter rail system that serves six large Southern California counties, said that officials spent most of the day on Monday figuring out what exactly the federal court ruling meant.But once he got word that the Transportation Security Administration would be lifting its mask requirement, he said, Metrolink decided to follow suit. “Not having this in place now gives people peace of mind that at least our conductors aren’t having to enforce something that was very difficult to enforce,” he said.— Jill Cowan,\\xa0Sophie Kasakove,\\xa0Tariro Mzezewa,\\xa0Robert Chiarito and Matt Berg Masks work best when everyone around you is wearing one. That’s because when a person infected with the coronavirus wears a mask, a large percentage of the infectious particles they exhale are trapped, stopping viral spread at the source. And when fewer viral particles are floating around the room, the masks others are wearing are likely to block those particles that have escaped.But there is also plenty of evidence showing that masks protect the wearer, even when others around them are mask-free.The amount of protection depends on the quality of the mask and how well it fits. Health experts recommend using an N95, KN95 or KF94 to protect yourself against the Omicron subvariant known as BA.2, which is now the dominant version of the coronavirus and is far more infectious than previous forms.Other variables, such as how much time you are exposed to an infected person and how well a space is ventilated, also will affect your risk.On most planes, for example, the cabin air is frequently pumped through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that are pretty good at reducing virus transmission. But that does not completely eliminate your risk.In a modeling study, published in December 2021, researchers found that passengers sitting in the same row or one row away from someone with the virus still had a high risk of getting infected through direct respiratory droplets. Wearing a mask reduced the risk of infection by 54 percent.In closed settings like a plane, it can be hard to avoid a mixed group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, symptomatic or asymptomatic people, all of whom may transmit the coronavirus at varying levels. And the flight may not even be the riskiest part of a trip.Air circulation may be running at low strength or completely turned off during boarding and deplaning, so those periods, as well as the time you spend at the airport, may be when you are at most risk of exposure and may benefit from wearing a mask.Other settings may be even more worrisome.“I know everyone talks about planes, but I would say buses are probably the riskiest, then trains and then planes, in order of highest to lowest,” said Linsey Marr, an expert in aerosol transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech.“People talk about planes having great ventilation filtration, and they do and that greatly helps reduce the risk of transmission,” she added. “But the virus is going to be in the air, no question in my mind, because there’s still large numbers of cases.”There is real-world data supporting the protective effects of masking in other indoor locations. In a 2020 investigation of a hotel outbreak in Switzerland, for instance, several employees and a guest who tested positive for the coronavirus were wearing only face shields (with no masks); those who wore masks were not infected.A number of laboratory studies, too, have documented that a mask protects the person who is wearing it, though the level of that protection can vary depending on the type of mask, the material it is made from, the experimental setup and how particle exposure was measured.While the lab studies all show a mask can protect the wearer, how well the masks perform in the real world depends on a number of variables, including how consistently people use them, whether a person is in high-risk situations and the rate of infection in the community.The laboratory studies showed that a high-quality medical mask, like an N95, KN95 or KF94, works best. While vaccination and a booster shot or two provide the best protection against infection with the coronavirus, even vaccinated people should be cautious around crowds or large groups indoors when the vaccination status of others is not known.Dr. Marr recommends wearing the highest-quality mask possible when you can’t keep your distance or be outdoors — or when nobody around you is masking up. That means an N95 or its equivalent.Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.— Tara Parker-Pope and Knvul Sheikh After a federal judge struck down the United States mask mandate for planes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, several European airlines made mask-wearing optional for passengers on their trans-Atlantic flights.The rules in Europe were already shifting, and a number of European countries were well ahead of the United States in easing coronavirus travel restrictions, including mask mandates and pre-departure testing for air travel. Many European airlines have been requiring passengers and crew members to wear face coverings only on flights to countries that require them.Britain dropped all its remaining coronavirus travel restrictions last month, and British Airways and Virgin Atlantic were among the first carriers to make mask-wearing optional, unless the destination required masks. Both airlines updated their mask policies on Tuesday to make masks optional on flights to U.S. destinations.“We encourage everyone to be respectful of fellow passengers’ mask preferences, and across our network, we continue to adhere to all regulatory requirements, recognizing that mask requirements differ by market,” Virgin Atlantic said in a statement on Tuesday.Other European airlines, like Air France and Lufthansa, said they would continue to enforce mask mandates on all their routes, in line with French and German coronavirus regulations. The Dutch airline KLM stopped enforcing mask mandates last month, but said it “strongly recommends” that passengers wear them, in line with guidance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.— Ceylan Yeginsu For many flight attendants, the striking down of the mask mandate for planes brought relief on Tuesday.Flight crews have faced a surge in threats and violence from passengers during the pandemic. In many cases, the rage is sparked by resistance to complying with the mask mandate, which is enforced by the crews on planes.“I’ve got nothing but extremely positive feedback,” said John Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents thousands of flight attendants and other airline, railroad and transit workers. “There was and remains a tension in the air.”David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue Airways who is now chief executive of Breeze Airways, said that he and many of his crew members welcomed the news. “They don’t like being policemen on airplanes,” he said. “It’s not something that they signed up for, and I think it creates more agitation with customers.”Unions representing flight attendants and pilots have long called for stronger action to address the increase in violence, with many welcoming a proposed bill in Congress that would impose tougher penalties for those convicted of assaulting flight crews and place those individuals on a no-fly list.For flight attendants who choose to do so, being able to work without masks may also help them to regain an important tool for de-escalating conflicts, too.“Even just a smile, even just to say ‘good morning,’ ‘good afternoon,’ ‘welcome aboard,’ hopefully that will help to decrease tension on board as well,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of TWU Local 556, which represents about 17,000 Southwest Airlines flight attendants. “It seems like a little thing, but it’s actually something we use quite a lot.”The new policy also created issues.“Yesterday’s mid-flight announcements on the lifting of mask mandates created confusion and uncertainty in our cabins,” Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, said in a statement.At Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning, most agents with the Transportation Security Administration kept their faces covered, at least at the Terminal 3 security checkpoint.A masked agent, who was checking luggage, stood next to a bare-faced colleague. Around the airport, blue signs reminded travelers, “Masks required! All travelers and employees must wear a face covering over their nose and mouth while in the airport.” Of three gate agents at D1, only one kept his face covered. Two pilots strode maskless through the terminal and onto a plane.Pilots seemed to be in a buoyant mood on Monday evening. In a widely shared video, passengers on a flight from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska, were heard applauding after a pilot congratulated them for being able to remove their masks.Jonathan Russell Biehl, a pilot for Delta Air Lines, was midway between Tampa and Minneapolis when he got a message about the dropping of the mask rule. “I would say this is the day I’ve been waiting for a long time,” Mr. Biehl, 46, said on Tuesday. “It’s really exciting not to have to be forced to wear a mask against my will.”It was not immediately clear what effect the removal of mask requirements would have on travel demand. Airlines are enjoying a robust rebound. Last week, Delta reported that March was its best sales month ever.— Niraj Chokshi,\\xa0Heather Murphy and Kristin Hussey The announcement by major U.S. airlines on Monday that they would drop mask mandates after a federal judge struck down the nationwide requirement has raised fresh questions about Covid safety on flights.On most single-aisle planes, you are constantly breathing a mixture of fresh and recirculated air. The air in the cabin is filtered and refreshed roughly every two to three minutes — a higher rate than in grocery stores and other indoor spaces, experts say. It’s one reason, in addition to safety protocols, that there have not been many superspreader events documented on flights since the beginning of the pandemic.But that doesn’t mean flights are completely safe.In early 2021, with the help of researchers, The New York Times simulated more than 2 million air particles to understand how they flow within the cabin, and how potential viral elements may pose a risk.As air blows from the sides of the plane, particles move toward the aisle, where they combine with air from the opposite row. To prevent air from circulating throughout the cabin, the ventilation system keeps it contained to a few rows.Not all particles are the same size, and most don’t contain infectious viral matter. But if someone were to sneeze, for example, even if that person were wearing a mask, the chances of passengers nearby inhaling viral particles greatly increase.See how the ventilation system works:— Mika Gröndahl As vaccines become widely available and restrictions are eased, millions of people are flying again, raising questions about just how safe it is now to board a flight.Moderna announced preliminary results Tuesday from its study of a coronavirus vaccine intended to protect against variants, saying the findings show it can design a vaccine that offers better, longer-lasting protection than its initial product.But the company said it was also testing another version of the vaccine that it expected would do even better, with results expected in late May or early June.The company’s findings, published in a paper without being evaluated by outside scientists, offer hope that the nation will have a better vaccine by the fall, when the coronavirus is considered likely to re-emerge in force.Researchers at Moderna, other pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health have been racing to figure out how to redesign the existing vaccines in time for new booster doses to be manufactured over the summer. Moderna’s results are the first of their kind to be released.The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech continue to strongly protect most people from hospitalization and death caused by Covid-19. But their potency against infection wanes quickly. Federal officials recently authorized additional shots for people 50 and older, citing concerns about waning protection against severe disease in vulnerable populations.Moderna said its research showed the promise of a so-called bivalent vaccine, even against other variants besides the two versions of the virus specifically targeted. In this case, researchers combined the existing vaccine with one designed to attack the Beta variant, which was first detected in late 2020. They found the combination provided a stronger defense not only against those forms of the virus, but also against the Delta and Omicron variants, the company said.Volunteers who got a booster shot of the reconfigured vaccine produced more than two times the level of antibodies against the Omicron variant compared with those who got a booster dose of the existing Moderna vaccine. The added protection persisted for six months against the Omicron variant but fell against Delta to essentially the same level as that elicited by the existing vaccine, the study showed.Moderna said although Beta was an early variant, it was relevant to test because it contains several mutations that “have been persistent in more recent variants of concern, including Omicron.”— Sharon LaFraniere After two years of warning travelers to avoid visiting a very long list of countries deemed to be “high risk” for coronavirus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped them all from its list.The change happened on Monday because the C.D.C. revised its international Covid-19 travel advisory system, and now reserves its most serious warning category, Level 4, for extreme situations like “rapidly escalating case trajectory or extremely high case counts, emergence of a new variant of concern, and health care infrastructure collapse,” the C.D.C. said in an update. Previously, the agency determined which countries warranted Level 4 warnings based on counts of new coronavirus cases.The U.S. Travel Association and airline executives have asked the C.D.C. and the Biden administration to ease restrictions and mask mandates for international travel in order to help airlines bounce back from a steep loss of business during the pandemic. A judge struck down the federal mask mandate for public transportation on Monday, prompting many airlines to immediately drop their mask requirements.Before the C.D.C. revised its advisory system on Monday, more than 90 countries were in the Level 4 category, including Costa Rica, France and Iceland.Levels 1, 2 and 3 in the system continue to be determined primarily by new-case counts over the most recent 28 days. Countries and territories with a “high level of Covid-19” — \\xa0currently, 122 of them — are put in Level 3 and those with a “moderate level of Covid-19” are put in Level 2 — currently a dozen. (The United States also qualifies for Level 3.)Travelers who are not fully vaccinated are advised to avoid traveling to Level 2 or Level 3 countries entirely, and people with weak immune systems are advised to speak to their doctors about how to stay safe when traveling there.Countries with a “low level of Covid-19” — currently 55 of them — are put in Level 1, and the C.D.C. recommends that travelers be up-to-date with vaccines before visiting them.Some 48 countries and territories are not assigned any level in the travel advisory system because not enough data was available. The C.D.C. warns travelers who are not fully vaccinated to avoid such places; many are small and remote, but some are tourist destinations.Although there are no longer any blanket “do not travel” warnings related to the coronavirus, travelers should still be aware that many countries have pandemic-related entry requirements. And the C.D.C. has issued warnings over issues unrelated to the coronavirus, like the lack of medical infrastructure in Venezuela and polio in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.The State Department said last week that it would adjust its own travel advisories and would no longer automatically correlate its guidance with the C.D.C.’s. Even so, if the C.D.C. assigns a country to Level 4 because of pandemic risk, the State Department’s travel advisory for that destination will also rise to Level 4.— Isabella Grullón Paz On Monday, a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation. The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do. By late Monday, the nation’s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights, and the Amtrak rail system had lifted its mandate.For many, the announcement was welcomed. Travelers who were already on their way when the announcement came cheered and de-masked midflight. Some employees said they had been frustrated by having to police passengers. But for others, the announcement has been met with alarm and concern about the spread of the coronavirus.Our reporters want to know how you feel about the announcement and whether it will change your masking behavior.Tell us your perspective below. We won’t use your name or identifying information without your permission, and we may contact you to hear more.— The New York Times Airbnb announced today that the lodging company would no longer issue refunds for Covid-19 related cancellations starting May 31, 2022.“As a result of this new way of living, beginning 31 May, we are updating our Extenuating Circumstances policy to no longer cover Covid-19 related circumstances as a reason for a refund for bookings made on or after this date,” the company said in a press release. This updated policy doesn’t apply to reservations made in South Korea and China. Airbnb quickly pivoted to say that other companies in the travel industry also rolled back similar policies earlier this year, or didn’t provide one at all. While Airbnb did not specify which of their competitors they were referring to, Vrbo, a similar service, has also recently updated its guidelines related to Covid-19 related cancelations, saying a property’s cancelation policy may apply even if a reservation is impacted by Covid-19.Airbnb did say that two-thirds of the listings on their site offered guests the chance to cancel a reservation no less than 5 days before check-in for a full refund. Some listings even offer full refunds for cancellation up to 24-hours before check-in. So, there’s still a chance you could get your money back if something comes up. The news comes after yesterday’s companywide announcement that Airbnb would be moving to a hybrid work schedule, which would allow employees to live and work wherever they want, de-centralizing the office from the company’s culture. While this shift to a permanent hybrid work configuration doesn’t seem to be directly due to the current state of Covid-19 (which Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed is no longer a pandemic in the U.S.), it is clearly fueled by the shift to remote work that began in March 2020.“Two years ago, the world was turned upside down. Our offices closed and we found ourselves working from our bedrooms, basements, and home offices,” CEO Brian Chesky wrote to Airbnb employees in an email. He continued: The right solution should combine the best of the digital world and the best of the physical world. It should have the efficiency of Zoom, while providing the meaningful human connection that only happens when people come together. We have a solution that we think combines the best of both worlds.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.While the pandemic normalized the ability to work remotely, it also kinda gave people a ‘get out of jail free’ card when it came to canceling plans—including vacation reservations. While Covid-19 will soon no longer be a valid reason to get a refund from an Airbnb cancelation, the impact of the pandemic will still be around when it comes to the ability for their employees to work remotely. AdvertisementBy Julian E. BarnesWilliam J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, a day after meeting with President Biden.The meeting was not considered a close contact for Mr. Biden because the two practiced social distancing and Mr. Burns was wearing an N95 mask, according to a C.I.A. statement. Mr. Biden tested negative on Wednesday when he was screened as part of regular health monitoring, an administration official said.Mr. Burns, who is 65, fully vaccinated and boosted, is experiencing mild symptoms, the C.I.A. statement said, adding that he is now isolating and will work from his home. He will return to the agency’s headquarters in Virginia after isolating for five days and then testing negative for the virus.The positive test will prevent Mr. Burns from briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill or attending White House briefings while he remains in isolation. Though Mr. Burns attends intelligence briefings at the White House several times a month, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, has primary responsibility for Mr. Biden’s regular intelligence sessions.Mr. Burns will continue to perform his duties from home rather than handing responsibility to David S.

Anyone can read what you share.By Peter Baker and Aishvarya KaviWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday, becoming the latest high-ranking official in Washington to be infected amid renewed concern about President Biden’s potential exposure as the virus ripples through his administration.Ms. Harris received her test results shortly after returning to the White House following several days in California, then left the West Wing without seeing Mr. Biden to isolate at the vice president’s residence. While she typically sees the president most weekdays they are both in town, aides said she had not been with him in person in eight days.Two Democratic senators, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, also tested positive on Tuesday, depriving Democrats of a working majority to push through legislation or nominations for the next few days. In an evenly split Senate, Democrats need every member plus the vice president’s tiebreaking vote to overcome uniform Republican opposition.Senate Democrats had hoped to approve multiple nominations this week, including Lisa D. Cook to be a governor of the Federal Reserve and Alvaro Bedoya to be a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Given that neither received any Republican support during earlier procedural votes, the latest Covid absences scrambled the equation for Democrats.While Ms. Harris by happenstance has not been near Mr. Biden in recent days, her infection served as a reminder of the dangers for Mr. Biden, who at 79 is the oldest person ever sworn into the presidency and in an age group considered more vulnerable to the virus. He has been traveling and appearing in public more lately, including three trips out of town last week, which increases his potential exposure, and aides on Tuesday sounded resigned to the prospect that he may be infected eventually.“It is possible he could test positive for Covid, just like any American,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. “Even though he’s double-boosted, that is possible. And we will be very transparent if that were to take place.”She said the president and his staff make a risk assessment for his travels outside the White House and he has proceeded lately with trips that he considers “vitally important to him, to his presidency, to the American people.”Mr. Biden plans to deliver a eulogy for former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright at a memorial service on Wednesday at Washington National Cathedral, where he will be among an estimated 1,400 mourners, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr. Biden is also scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association annual dinner on Saturday night, along with about 2,600 officials, journalists and others in a basement hotel ballroom.The most recent of these big Washington grip-and-grin dinners led to an extensive outbreak that swept through much of the capital’s elite. At least 80 guests at the Gridiron Dinner last month tested positive afterward, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three members of Mr. Biden’s cabinet: Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.Ms. Harris was not at the dinner, but her communications director, Jamal Simmons, attended and tested positive afterward. The infections of both the vice president and House speaker mean that the first and second in line of succession to the presidency have now been hit by the virus in short order.Ms. Harris, 57, received her second booster shot on April 1, three days after federal regulators authorized a second dose of the vaccine for people over age 50. It takes about a week for a shot to boost the immune system. Mr. Biden has also received a second booster shot. The last time the two were together was on April 18, according to a White House official.Ms. Harris, who returned from a trip to San Francisco and Los Angeles on Monday, went to her office at the White House on Tuesday morning and took a rapid antigen test as part of the regular protocol for the president and vice president. When it came back positive, she took a P.C.R. test, which also came back positive. At that point, rather than attend the daily intelligence briefing with the president as scheduled, she returned home, where aides said she would remain until she tests negative. Mr. Biden later called to check in on her, aides said.After consulting her doctors, Ms. Harris also started a course of Paxlovid, her press secretary said in a tweet. The antiviral pill made by Pfizer is intended for high-risk patients, and it was not immediately clear whether she qualified.Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris’s husband, tested positive for the virus in mid-March. At the time, Ms. Harris was forced to back out of an event with the president, although she continued to test negative. Mr. Emhoff told McClatchy News last week that he had isolated from his wife for 10 days while infected, staying in an upstairs room and having food brought up to him.The spate of infections in the upper reaches of Washington came amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA.2, and served as a reminder that the pandemic endures even as officials seek to roll back restrictions.Officials in the White House said they were contact tracing to determine who may have been near Ms. Harris in recent days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a close contact as someone who spends at least 15 minutes within six feet of the infected person over a 24-hour period. Officials have repeatedly emphasized that the White House maintains stricter measures than the C.D.C. advises.AdvertisementBy Robin BrantBBC Shanghai correspondentThis video can not be playedDozens of elderly patients at a hospital in Shanghai have died after contracting Covid-19, but official government figures claim no deaths in the city have been caused by the disease since 2020.The BBC has spoken to a hospital manager and had access to correspondence sent to relatives of patients who\\'ve died during the Omicron outbreak that is sweeping through China\\'s biggest city.We\\'ve also had access to official documents that suggest at least 27 patients from a single hospital, who weren\\'t vaccinated, have died from what it called \"underlying health problems\".Shanghai is enforcing a mammoth lockdown as authorities try to contain a new wave of the virus. Most of the city\\'s almost 25 million population have been ordered to stay inside for three weeks.The BBC has previously reported evidence that authorities in Shanghai are struggling to deal with the outbreak. We spoke to a nurse and a health worker at Donghai Elderly Care Hospital who, between them, described desperate attempts to help dozens of elderly patients, some of whom have died.We\\'ve contacted several other care homes or hospitals for the elderly since then, after social media postings suggested there was evidence of widespread infections among hundreds of patients in 12 other facilities here.One relative of a patient at another care home in Shanghai has told us that doctors and caregivers working there had informed her that everyone in the facility had tested positive. It has capacity for around 300 patients.In a phone conversation a manager at Donghai Hospital told us: \"Of course there would be deceased with Covid. [In] Shanghai the situation is like this. How could there not be any death[s] without Covid?\"In a letter sent to relatives of patients who\\'d died management at the hospital apologised and admitted a \"lack of professionalism\". They also expressed their \"deepest guilt\".Official figures say there have been no deaths during the current outbreak across the city; none at all. China has a strict criteria for confirming Covid-19 cases, which includes evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus. This must be confirmed in a scan.Any underlying health conditions is also considered before deaths are officially attributed to Covid.One man whose 72-year-old sister died at Donghai earlier this month told us that he had struggled to get a full explanation from officials about the cause of death. He told us that she had tested negative in the weeks before she died on 3 April. But he was not able to get a record of her test results in the final days before she died.The man said his sister was one of six patients in a room, five of whom died. He told the BBC that \"the outbreak [was] so bad in that care home\". As far as he could tell the official record said \"she died with Covid negative\". He said he would not go ahead with her cremation until he knew what the cause of death was.Relatives of a 99-year-old woman who died on 1 April have also raised concerns about the cause of death, given that she tested positive in the final week of her life.In social media postings seen by the BBC, with accompanying audio records, her granddaughter said the woman had been transferred to Jinshan Public Health Clinical Centre in Shanghai on 27 March, where she tested positive a day later.She was treated for underlying health problems. Three days later she tested negative for Covid. A day later she died. The woman described her death as due to \"aggravation of underlying disease due to Covid\". The BBC tried multiple times to contact authorities at Donghai and Jinshan regarding the various allegations, but was not able to get a response.China is facing its most serious crisis since the virus first emerged here in early 2020, when the city of Wuhan was locked down and sealed off.Despite efforts to limit the impact on the economy in the country\\'s financial capital the lockdown of Shanghai has continued way beyond the initial nine day period planned for. Authorities have used various terms to refer to the strict restrictions being imposed on people, calling it \"static management\" and \"closed management\".State media reported that President Xi Jinping said \"prevention and control work cannot be relaxed\".

              "'The White House has launched covid.gov, a dedicated website for COVID-19 guidance, including resources for treatment and testing. The site is meant to be a “one-stop shop” for all things related to COVID-19, including testing and treatment options, masks and vaccines. The website also provides county-level data from the CDC about community spread of COVID-19.The website includes a new “test-to-treat” locator that connects people with testing sites and treatment options in their area. “This program creates one-stop-shop locations where people can get a COVID-19 test and receive an oral antiviral treatment, if appropriate for them because they test positive and face high risks from COVID,” the White House wrote in a statement. “Since the launch earlier this month, there are now over 2,000 Test-to-Treat locations nationwide, including in pharmacy-based clinics, federally-qualified community health centers (FQHCs), and long-term care facilities.”Today, our Administration is launching https://t.co/NDM1ko6LYN, a new one-stop shop website to help all people in the U.S. gain even better access to lifesaving tools like vaccines, tests, treatments, and masks, as well as get the latest updates on COVID-19 in their area. pic.twitter.com/ps5ZPg1fQHWhile much of the information on covid.gov has already been available, the White House says it’s the first time that it’s brought all of its COVID-19 guidance and resources into one place. For example, it links to both vaccines.gov as well as the USPS site to order free COVID tests. It also includes links to find “high quality” masks, and resources on how to wear them.Subscribe to our newsletter or check out the latestPlease enter a valid email addressTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.Megan CarnegieTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.In the midst of a Covid-19 flare-up and almost two calendar years into the pandemic, England last week dropped all its protective measures against the spread of the virus. In doing so, it is following the lead of countries like Denmark, Switzerland, and the Dominican Republic, which have removed legal requirements to self-isolate after a positive test.In these countries, there is no longer a support net that enables people to avoid financial penalties if they fall ill. Until now in England, employees have been able to claim statutory sick pay (SSP) from the first day of illness, which amounts to £96.35 ($127) a week. In a similar approach, countries like Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, Sweden, and France waived waiting periods for sick pay and sickness benefits to fight the spread of the virus.With Covid-19 infection levels in some areas of the UK at their highest since the pandemic began, the government’s decision to drop restrictions is problematic. UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s advice to cope with these changes was to “be more disciplined about not going into work when you are sick.” He encouraged Britons to break a lifelong habit of presenteeism and be more like German workers. Except Germans receive 100 percent of their pay for eight weeks if they fall ill, representing one of the highest sick-pay rates in Europe. Britons get the lowest. In the US, where the government is under pressure to drop Covid-19 restrictions and mask mandates, there is no statutory sick pay at all.Staying home when sick has never been part of the UK’s cultural fabric, where employees face pressure to not “let down the side.” Going into work when sick is the norm in the country, even when the illness could easily be passed on to others. Data from 2016 found that 86 percent of Britons would go into work with an infectious illness. The same research found that almost a quarter feel their manager would prefer it if they attended work in those circumstances. And so the contagion can spread.When the pandemic was in its early stages, there was some hope that it would end, or at least reduce, presenteeism in the workplace. However, in a country where statutory sick pay is getting worse, this is nothing but a pipe dream. In an era of remote work, the need to soldier on has prevailed. In the first year of the pandemic, Britons actually took fewer sick days than in 2019, reaching the lowest rate since 1995. Over half of hybrid workers (52 percent) and nearly half of remote workers (44 percent) said they feel obligated to work while unwell when they’re working remotely.The correlation between paid sick leave and sick days taken is hard to ignore. Workers offered the most generous sick pay take the most absences, and those offered the least, take the least. Employees in Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, and Belgium, who receive 100 percent of their wages from their first week of illness and for a month minimum, also take some of the most sick days in Europe. On average, Germans take 18.3 days off sick every year, while Britons take just 5.8. Incentivizing staying home from day one is particularly important in the context of Covid, as viral load and risk of infection peak quickly once symptoms begin and people can remain contagious for up to 10 days.Alex Collinson, an analysis and research officer at the UK’s Trades Union Congress (TUC), points out that the reintroduction of the three-day waiting period means that if someone isolates for five days of a week, they only get paid for two days. “It brings SSP down from £96 a week to £39, which is not enough to live off,” he says. “It’s a massive barrier to doing the right thing.”The TUC is proposing an increase to around £346 per week, as suggested by the Living Wage Foundation. “When people get sick, they should not be faced with financial hardship for taking time off,” says Collinson.\\xa0The new rules are particularly galling for those who are clinically vulnerable and may struggle to return to the workplace. Alison Crockford works in cybersecurity as an awareness manager and is immunosuppressed due to a kidney transplant. “I would love to go back to the office on a hybrid model, but now that testing and isolation is no longer the norm, it\\'s far more difficult for me to travel to the office and work safely,” she explains.“The perception that those with underlying conditions ‘were going to die anyway’ and couldn’t be happy, functioning members of society depresses me,” says the 41-year-old. “The ‘othering’ of anyone who’s not fortunate enough to be completely healthy right now is exhausting.”Beyond “getting better at not going to work while sick,” no part of England’s plan gives a credible explanation on how the immunocompromised and people with disabilities are meant to live and do their jobs alongside the virus.“We’ve worked well in the UK for some time to advance ability-status equality in the workplace, but the lifting of these measures takes a step back,” explains Simon Williams, a behavioral scientist at Swansea University. Indeed, data gathered by the UK\\'s Office for National Statistics (ONS) in mid-March shows that people with disabilities were more likely to think life would never return to normal, and 57 percent are avoiding close contact with those they don’t live with, compared to 41 percent of nondisabled. The majority are spending more time at home too.Throughout the pandemic, close attention has been paid to the number of Britons who\\'ve lost their lives to Covid, but less has been paid to those who have lost their health to long Covid. The true impact of this debilitating condition is beginning to come to light. According to self-reported stats from the ONS, 1.3 million Britons are experiencing symptoms lasting longer than four weeks since they were infected, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Some 18 percent report that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities has been limited “a lot.”Needless to say, the impact on businesses has—and will be—monumental. A quarter of British employers cite long Covid as the main cause for long-term health-related absence, in a survey of 804 organizations with over 4.3 million employees by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Some 46 percent have employees with long Covid. The Resolution Foundation think tank suggests there’s a high chance that it’s a contributing factor in the UK’s labor shortage and the “Great Resignation.” The same is true in the US, according to the Brookings Institution.The TUC is calling for the government to recognize long Covid as a disability. “It would protect workers under the Equality Act and, most importantly, give them the right to reasonable adjustments at work,” says Collinson. “That includes everything from flexible working arrangements to longer rest breaks and special software and equipment.”An innate work ethic, pressure from the top, and financial worries are all contributing factors, but as employees return to offices, Williams says, this overarching presenteeism is terrible for public health. “It contributes to avoidable transmission of infectious illnesses—not just Covid—which isn’t cost-effective for businesses,” he says. “A lot of countries have much better sick pay, and raising it would help to change a culturally ingrained habit of feeling unwell, complaining about it, but doing it anyway.”With absenteeism now a luxury many workers can’t afford, the pressure is on individual businesses to foster environments that recognize all levels of vulnerability. “We do have to live with Covid and focus on personal responsibility,” says Williams. “But there’s a danger that if we say personal responsibility or policy, we throw the baby out with the bathwater.”The best approach is a set of policies that entrust people with the ability to exercise responsibility and be cautious. At the very least, if governments want people to self isolate—and they should—they need to get paid enough to live on. Perhaps then, they could be more like the Germans.More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Ad ChoicesAdvertisementNewsletterThe U.S. may soon run out of Covid money. That’s not the only problem. Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By David LeonhardtThe short-term and long-term flaws with the country’s current Covid-19 policy are quite different.In the short term, the main problem is a lack of demand for Covid vaccines and treatments: Not enough people are trying to get them. In the longer term — by the second half of this year — the bigger problem may end up being a lack of supply, especially if cases surge again.I think this distinction has gotten lost in some of the public discussion. Yesterday, President Biden called for additional Covid funding, after Congress had left out such money from its most recent spending bill because of a disagreement over how to pay for it.“We need to secure additional supply now,” Biden said in a brief speech, shortly before receiving his second booster shot onstage. “We can’t wait until we find ourselves in the midst of another surge to act. It’ll be too late.”Biden is right that the lack of funding creates problems. To ensure an adequate supply of vaccines and treatments later this year, the government probably needs to take action soon. Democrats and Republicans have been negotiating over a possible deal this week.But the potential funding shortfall is nowhere near the entire problem. A lack of money is not preventing many Americans from getting vaccinated or getting valuable treatments right now. Even if Congress does pass more Covid funding, the country will still face a problem that is more about information and persuasion than dollars.For months, the United States has been awash in Covid vaccine shots, and many Americans would benefit from getting one. About one-quarter of adults remain unvaccinated, while roughly another quarter are vaccinated but not boosted, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A booster shot sharply reduces the chances of severe Covid illness, especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and immunocompromised.I know that last point may sound counterintuitive. The elderly and immunocompromised, even if boosted, face a higher risk of severe illness than a healthy, younger person. But a booster shot still reduces the risk more for a vulnerable person than for an average person. It’s a common dynamic in medicine: Treatments tend to be most valuable for the most vulnerable even if they do not eliminate risk.Despite the huge value of additional vaccine shots, many Americans simply aren’t getting one. The number of shots given per day, including both initial doses and boosters, has fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign, in early 2021.Including first, second and booster doses2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.March2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.March2 million doses1221,000average doseson March 28Jan. 2022Feb.MarchSource: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBy The New York TimesWhat might help?Employer and customer mandates would probably nudge more people to get initial shots. Previous employer mandates have generally caused more people to get vaccinated and only a tiny share to quit or be fired. But mandates have fallen out of fashion. Even some politically liberal places, like New York City and Washington, D.C., have been dropping theirs recently.Boosting more people seems as if it should be more feasible, because it involves people who have already received a shot. Still, boosters are lagging. Many Americans seem confused about how much a booster shot matters.The scientific evidence suggests that everybody who is eligible should get a first booster shot. A second booster shot — now available to people 50 and older, among others — may also make sense, although the benefits appear smaller. And if you are boosted and have already had Omicron, you probably don’t need another booster yet, Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research notes (as part of his helpful overview of the evidence).The story is similar with both Evusheld (a drug that appears to boost immunity among the immunocompromised) and post-infection treatments that reduce the chance of severe illness. They are widely available, yet many people remain unaware of them.Many doctors also seem uncertain how and when to prescribe them. “Doctors are beginning to use this,” a Biden administration official told me, “but it takes a while for things to get absorbed in medical practice.”Biden yesterday announced a new federal website — Covid.gov — where people can search for pharmacies near them that have both Evusheld and the treatments. I found most parts of it simple to use. But I also thought that Rob Relyea, a Microsoft engineer who has become an advocate for the immunocompromised, made a good critique on Twitter: The Evusheld information is too hard to find.The bottom line is that Americans would benefit from hearing a series of clear, repeated messages:Getting a booster shot may save your life.Many immunocompromised people would probably be helped by Evusheld, and it’s available.Vulnerable people — like the elderly — should talk with a doctor as soon as they test positive for Covid and seek treatments that can reduce its severity, like Paxlovid or molnupiravir.As Biden said yesterday, “America has the tools to protect people.”If more people become aware of the treatments, however, some of them are likely to run low later this year. And if the federal government waits until then to act, it may discover that other countries have bought the available supply. “You can’t snap your fingers and buy the stuff,” the Biden administration official told me.Already, the administration has reduced shipments of one kind of treatment — monoclonal antibodies — that it is sending to states. It has also said it would cut back on new orders of Evusheld in the next several days.A Covid bill would likely cost $10 billion to $15 billion, or less than 0.25 percent of the annual federal budget. Congressional Republicans have said that the money should be diverted from another area, rather than add to the deficit. My colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, who covers the pandemic from Washington, said Congress was likely to agree on a funding source soon, perhaps before lawmakers leave for their April recess. But nobody knows for sure.Related:Several states are closing mass vaccination and testing sites.

Now, queer romance novels are coming from the biggest publishers and are prominently displayed in stores.Some of them become best sellers, like “Red, White & Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston, a 2019 love story about a British prince and the American president’s son. Experts see its success as a turning point for the genre. Publishers long assumed that only L.G.B.T.Q. readers were interested in queer romance novels. But readers regularly tell McQuiston, “Oh, my mom and her book club are reading that.”The new novels also break from the longstanding trope of queer characters meeting tragic ends. An L.G.B.T.Q. romance novel promises the opposite. “Customers will come in and say, ‘I just want something that’s gay and happy,’” Laynie Rose Rizer, a bookshop manager in Washington, D.C., said. “And I’m like, ‘I have 10 different options for you.’”Egg salad that’s gorgeous and delicious.Starring Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke, the new Marvel series “Moon Knight” follows a troubled, crime-fighting caped crusader.“I’m not a bad girl,” Joan Collins tells The Times. “But I had dark hair and green eyes, and I suppose they said that I smoldered.”Stephen Colbert condemned Trump.The pangrams from yesterday’s Spelling Bee were drooping, dropping and prodding.

After two years of battling Covid-19 and related burnout, nurses say it’s been a welcome relief.“There\\'s two levels of burnout: There\\'s ‘we’re short this weekend’ burnout, and then there\\'s pandemic burnout, which our care teams are experiencing right now,” says Abigail Hamilton, a former ICU and emergency room nurse that manages nursing staff support programs at the hospital.Moxi is one of several specialized delivery robots that has been developed in recent years to ease the strain on health care workers. Even before the pandemic, nearly half of US nurses felt that their workplace lacked adequate work–life balance. The emotional toll of seeing patients die and colleagues infected at such a large scale—and fear of bringing Covid-19 home to family—has made feelings of burnout worse. Studies also found that burnout can have long-term consequences for nurses, including cognitive impacts and insomnia years after the exhaustion of their early careers. The world already had a nurse shortage going into the pandemic; now, roughly two out of three nurses in the US say they have considered leaving the profession, according to a survey from the National Nurses United union.In some places the shortage is leading to higher wages for permanent staff and for temporary travel nurses. In countries such as Finland, nurses are demanding better pay and going on strike. But it’s also paved the way for more robots in health care settings.At the forefront of this trend is Moxi, which has spent the pandemic rolling down the halls of some of the largest hospitals in the country, carrying objects like a smartphone or beloved teddy bear to patients in emergency rooms when Covid-19 protocol kept family members from bedsides.Moxi was created by Diligent Robotics, a company cofounded in 2017 by Vivian Chu, a former Google X researcher, and Andrea Thomaz, who developed Moxi while working as an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The roboticists met when Thomaz advised Chu at Georgia Tech’s Socially Intelligent Machines Lab. The first Moxi commercial deployment came months after the start of the pandemic. About 15 Moxi robots are now operational in US hospitals, with an additional 60 scheduled to deploy later this year.“In 2018, any hospital that was thinking about working with us, it was a special project for the CFO or innovation project about the hospital of the future,” says Diligent Robotics CEO Andrea Thomaz. “What we saw over the last two years is that almost every single health care system is thinking about robotics and automation or has robotics and automation on their strategic agenda.”A range of robots have been developed in recent years to carry out health care tasks like disinfecting hospital wards or assisting physical therapists. Robots that touch people—like Robear, which helped lift elderly people out of bed in Japan—remain largely experimental, due in part to liability and regulatory requirements. Far more common are specialized delivery robots.Moxi is equipped with a robotic arm and can greet passersby with cooing sounds and heart eyes on a digital face. But in practice Moxi is less of a caregiver and more like Tug, another hospital delivery robot, or Burro, a robot helping farm workers in California grape vineyards. A camera on the front and lidar sensor on the back help Moxi map the floors of hospitals and spot people and items it should avoid.Nurses can hail Moxi robots from kiosks at nursing stations or send the robot a task via text message. Moxi might be used to transport items that are too big to fit into a tube system, like IV pumps; lab samples and other fragile cargo; or specialty items, like a slice of birthday cake.A survey of nurses who worked with delivery robots similar to Moxi in a hospital in Cyprus found that roughly half expressed concern that robots represent a threat to their jobs, but they have a long way to go before they could conceivably replace humans. Moxi still needs help with basic tasks. For example, Moxi might have to ask a human to press an elevator button for a specific floor.More concerning, the cybersecurity risks hospital delivery robots present aren’t very well understood. Last week, security firm Cynerio showed that exploiting a vulnerability can allow hackers to take remote control of Tug robots or open patients up to privacy violations. (No comparable bugs have been found in Moxi robots, and the company says it’s taking steps to ensure its “security position.”)Around the time of Moxi’s first commercial deployment in 2020, an American Nurses Association–supported case study assessed Moxi trials at hospitals in Dallas, Houston, and Galveston, Texas. Researchers cautioned that use of such robots requires more thorough supply management by hospital staff, because robots don’t read expiration dates; using expired bandages can increase risk of infections.A majority of the 21 nurses interviewed as part of the review said Moxi gave them more time to talk with patients being discharged from the hospital. Numerous nurses said Moxi saved them energy, brought joy to patients and their families, and ensured that patients always had water when it was time for them to take their medication. “I could do it faster, but it’s better for Moxi to do it so I can do something else more useful,” said one of the surveyed nurses. In less positive feedback, nurses complained that Moxi had trouble maneuvering through cramped halls during the morning rush or anticipating needs by accessing electronic health records. Another said some patients were suspicious of “the robot’s eyes recording them.” Authors of that case study concluded that Moxi is incapable of delivering skilled nursing care and is best suited to focusing on low-risk, repetitive tasks that can save nurses time.Those types of tasks can represent big business. In addition to its recent expansion into new hospitals, Diligent Robotics announced the closure of a $30 million funding round last week. The company will use the funding in part to more closely integrate Moxi’s software with electronic health records in order to carry out tasks without the need for a nurse or doctor to make a request.In her experience, Abigail Hamilton of Mary Washington Hospital says burnout has the power to force people into early retirement, push them toward temporary travel nurse work, impact their relationships with loved ones, or make them leave the industry altogether.Still, she says, the simple things Moxi does can make a difference. It can save nurses the 30 minutes it might take to go from the fifth floor to the basement to pick up medication that can’t go through the tube system from the pharmacy. And picking up after-hour meals for patients is one of Moxi’s most popular tasks. Since two Moxi robots began operating in the halls of Mary Washington Hospital in February, they’ve given workers back approximately 600 hours of time.“As a society, we’re not who we were in February 2020,” Hamilton said when explaining why her hospital uses robots. “We have to think of different ways to support caregivers at the bedside.”Updated 4/29/2022 9:55 am ET: This story has been updated to correct that the robot is just over 4 feet tall, not nearly 6 feet as previously stated, and to clarify that it was Thomaz who advised Chu at Georgia Tech.More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast.

For years before the pandemic, the Hungarian-American biochemist had been working to realize the therapeutic potential of mRNA—first trying to create a synthetic version of the messenger molecule that wouldn’t trigger the body’s inflammatory response, and then, once she and colleague Drew Weissman had achieved that goal, trying to get the medical and scientific community to pay attention.She had envisioned the technology being used to treat those recovering from heart attacks and strokes. But it was the frantic race for a Covid vaccine that earned Karikó belated global recognition. The work she and her colleagues had done on mRNA provided the foundation for Moderna and BioNTech to quickly develop Covid vaccines that have now saved millions of lives.Traditional vaccines train the immune system by introducing it to harmless versions of whole viruses—the body learns to recognize the virus’s key features, such as SARS-CoV-2’s infamous spike protein. These new mRNA vaccines found a more elegant way to achieve the same goal, using messenger RNA—a genetic molecule found throughout nature that’s used to transmit information within and between cells—to provide the body with a set of instructions on how to make the spike protein itself, essentially borrowing the body’s internal machinery and turning it into a photocopier.This difference allowed mRNA vaccines to be designed, created, and approved in record time. Over the past 18 months, mRNA technology has been injected into billions of arms and has helped slow the devastating impact of the pandemic. But its long-term impact—accelerated by Covid—could be even greater. “It seems like the sky is the limit,” says Karikó. “Previously the belief was not there.”Dozens of clinical trials are now underway for new forms of the mRNA vaccine—targeting everything from malaria to Zika, herpes, and cytomegalovirus. Last month, Moderna—which was founded in 2014 to explore the potential of mRNA—announced it had started Phase I clinical trials for two mRNA-based HIV vaccines. “The timeline for what can be achieved using the mRNA platform is so much better,” says Carl Dieffenbach, director of the Division of AIDS at the US National Institutes of Health, who is overseeing those trials.There was some work on mRNA happening before the pandemic—Moderna had spent years on the lipid envelope that encases the strand of mRNA in the vaccine, for instance. “Like all overnight successes, mRNA has been in development for a long time,” says Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority invested in an mRNA vaccine for Zika in 2016, but “the urgency sort of trailed off” as the outbreak subsided, Hatchett says. There had also been tentative attempts to develop mRNA platforms for other coronaviruses, such as MERS, work that proved crucial when Covid broke out. Moderna was able to tweak its MERS vaccine for the new disease, meaning its Covid vaccine entered clinical trials just 66 days after SARS-CoV-2’s genetic sequence was published.It’s true that mRNA vaccines would probably have come to market eventually, but they were on what Dieffenbach calls “a leisurely stroll.” Covid “pressure-tested” them—advancing their emergence by years or decades. Karikó remembers organizing the first mRNA conference in 2013 and says that nobody in attendance would have expected an FDA-approved product less than 10 years later. “Because of the success against Covid, we’re going to see tremendous investment, and we’re going to learn just how flexible it is and how finely we can target,” says Hatchett.One of mRNA’s strengths is its “remarkable agility,” as Hatchett puts it. Its only raw ingredients are the four nucleotides that form the “letters” of the RNA sequence, so it can be designed and made pretty rapidly. “Biological manufacturing is very hard and temperamental and has been difficult to introduce in many environments. It’s taken India decades to build up the vaccine manufacturing capability they have,” says Hatchett. “It may be easier for countries to develop an mRNA production capacity than traditional biological manufacturing capability.”Developing countries could, Hatchett suggests, leapfrog over traditional vaccine-manufacturing processes and go straight to mRNA—mRNA plants are already being planned in countries across Africa and Asia. After Covid, they could be quickly repurposed to create vaccines for other diseases—all you need to do is change the order of the bases in the mRNA to give the body a new set of instructions. There are also far fewer concerns about purity or contamination than with traditional vaccines—the body quickly translates, expresses, and breaks down the strand of mRNA.“mRNA is completely interchangeable,” says Jackie Miller, senior vice president for infectious diseases at Moderna. “What changes between the different vaccines is the DNA template that we utilize to synthesize the messenger RNA, but across all of our vaccine portfolio, we’re using the same lipid nanoparticle.”CEPI wants to use that flexibility to create a library of mRNA vaccines against each of the viral families known to cause human disease. This would cost $20 billion to $30 billion, Hatchett estimates, but it would enable a rapid response to any new outbreaks. “The lesson from 2020 is that 326 days [the time from sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 to administering the first doses of a Covid vaccine outside of trials  is terrific, astounding, and not fast enough,” he says. CEPI wants to be in a position to make a vaccine for emerging threats within 100 days. “mRNA is an essential, critical component of our being able to achieve that mission,” Hatchett says.CEPI’s other goal is to improve access to mRNA vaccines, which still need to be stored and transported at extremely cold temperatures (–80°C for Pfizer/BioNtech, –20°C for Moderna), which makes reaching remote areas challenging. The cold chain requirement and the cost are two reasons the majority of mRNA vaccines have been purchased and administered by higher-income countries. In India, 88 percent of people received the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is based on a different technology, doesn’t need to be kept so cold, and has been made available far more cheaply; in the US the overwhelming majority got mRNA vaccines.That problem will never go away completely—mRNA is inherently unstable, Karikó says, to the point that vaccine shipments can be ruined by a bumpy road—but there is a trade-off between temperature and shelf life; you can store vaccines at less extreme temperatures, but they will degrade faster. “In some parts of the world, this is not the most convenient presentation,” Miller says. Although mRNA could eventually be cheaper than traditional vaccine manufacturing, that’s not the case today—and ensuring equitable access could require some technical breakthroughs. Dieffenbach suggests freeze-drying vaccine particles for easier transport and storage as one potential solution—eventually mRNA could be squirted up the nose, inhaled as a powder, or applied using a patch. Self-amplifying RNA, which replicates itself inside the body, could enable lower doses, which could lessen the risk of side effects.Eventually, protection against multiple strains of a virus could be administered in a single shot. There are efforts to make universal vaccines for coronaviruses or influenza that would target their stable features—like the stalk of an influenza virus—getting around their ability to shift and mutate. “Even for those coronaviruses that are still in the bat and have not jumped to us, we will be protected,” Karikó says.Or, if that doesn’t work, there’s also the “sledgehammer” approach of putting multiple strains of mRNA into a single jab—a whole manual of instructions the body can use to recognize different strains of a virus. “Our goal ultimately is to develop these individual antigens but combine them in ways that if you’re getting a seasonal booster you don’t need to get multiple, you can get a single booster to cover against the most likely respiratory pathogens,” Miller says. A future mRNA flu jab—the most likely next step after Covid—could comprise specific instructions for that season’s most prevalent strain, but also primers for various different strains so that if there is a pandemic of, say, H7N9 flu, people’s immune systems won’t be going into it completely blind.There’s a world of applications beyond vaccines, too. Messenger RNA gives scientists and doctors a way to make essentially any protein they would like directly inside the body. Rather than coding for a spike protein to encourage the body to make antibodies against it, mRNA could be used to teach the body how to make those antibodies directly: Someone who survived an outbreak of an emerging disease could have their antibodies cloned, and the instructions for how to make them could be shared with others using mRNA, suggests Karikó.Years ago, she made a list of all the diseases she thought it was reasonable to treat using mRNA. There were more than 30 on the list, covering everything from cancer to everyday aches and pains. The design of the lipid coating that surrounds the mRNA could be tweaked to get the molecule to different places in the body: the lungs, the spleen, the bone marrow, depending on the exact condition or disease that needs to be treated.A protein that aids healing applied directly to a wound will wash away in hours with the flow of blood. But mRNA could be used to teach the cells in the wounded area to make and secrete that protein themselves. The body of a child with a genetic defect that means they can’t make a vital protein could be taught to make that protein, with mRNA instructions sent precisely to the area where it’s needed.“We always wanted it to be that everybody could use it,” says Karikó, from a hotel room in Tokyo, where she’s quarantining before a meeting with the Emperor of Japan—a sign of the global impact mRNA has already had. But we’ve only scratched the surface. If the logistical and technical hurdles can be overcome, and the technology can be distributed evenly, mRNA has the potential to transform every strand of medicine. “In the next 10 years, you will see unbelievable progress,” she says.Updated 4-19-2022 5:00 pm ET: This story was corrected to state that the letters of mRNA are nucleotides, not amino acids, and that it was the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, not CEPI, that funded the development of an mRNA vaccine for Zika in 2016.\\xa0More From WIREDContact© 2022 Condé Nast.

This is The Daily.Throughout the pandemic, as countries have struggled with disease and death, one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared— Central and Western Africa. My colleague, Stephanie Nolen, traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic.It’s Thursday, April 7.So, Stephanie, you’re a global health reporter at The Times. Tell me about the kind of reporting that you’ve been doing during the pandemic.So, generally, a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world, things like infectious disease, malaria, tuberculosis, H.I.V. But of course, in the Covid era, that’s mostly meant reporting on Covid. And I’ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world. And in February, I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries, and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven’t paid as much attention to in the pandemic.So I arrived in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, at what was the height of the Omicron wave. And I was coming from Canada, which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic. And I hired a vehicle with a driver, and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests. And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there, and it was really startling.We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying. There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it. Nobody had a mask on. And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people, are you worried about Covid? I mean, they knew what I was talking about, but they couldn’t fathom why I would be concerned. It was like time travel back to 2019, like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow.And right away, I thought, I need to understand what’s happening here. Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here? Or it is here, but it’s not making people sick? It’s not killing people? And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months, this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa, but until I saw it, I really didn’t understand just how puzzling this was. And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery.Stephanie, to that point, what’s the big picture here? I mean, tell me what’s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic. Catch me up on how it’s played out.So I’ll start with South Africa because that’s the country in sub-Saharan Africa that we know the most about. So South Africa, of course, has had a pretty rough time. The Beta variant was first identified there. The Omicron variant was first identified there. They’ve caused bad waves. We know that there have been probably 300,000 deaths caused by Covid in South Africa.As you move through the continent, it gets murkier. East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya, Uganda. There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full. But they’re rare stories. And as you move into Central and then Western Africa, there have been even fewer reports like this, right? Much, much lower reports of deaths. Sierra Leone is a country of 8 million people, and they’ve reported a total of 7,700 Covid cases and just 125 deaths.That seems incredibly low.It really is.So how did you start to answer that question, Stephanie? The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid. What did you do first?So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases. And the town that I was in, Kamakwie, happened to have the regional Covid coordinator’s office there. So I went across town and walked into the office.And it was completely empty, except for the district coordinator, the Covid coordinator, who I found sitting behind his desk, all alone in an otherwise completely empty office. He had a shiny new laptop in front of him, but no internet connection and, indeed, no power. And when I asked him what he knew about cases, he told me really proudly that they’d only had 11 since the start of the pandemic.Oh, wow, 11 for roughly what kind of population?Oh, it’s about 125,000 people in this district.Wow.So that was kind of shocking. But then the question was, well, how do you know? So I asked him what was happening with testing. And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital. So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital, thinking, OK, maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing.This is the hospital of the same region?It’s the district hospital serving those 125,000 people. And there was a lab, and there were three busy technicians in that lab. And when I said, what are you doing in terms of Covid testing, they were pretty blunt. There’s not a lot of resources in this hospital. So what they do when people come in is they triage. They test first for malaria. And if you don’t have malaria, they’ll test you for typhoid. And if you don’t have typhoid, then they’ll test you for Covid. And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point, they figured out what they have.So, Stephanie, it sounds like from your reporting what you’re finding is that, number one, the regional coordinator is not doing the testing. And number two, at the hospital, they have so many other urgent diseases, malaria, for example, that Covid is just really the last thing on their list.Exactly. There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country. So I went back down south to Freetown, to the capital. And I went to see Dr. Austin Demby, who is the health minister of Sierra Leone. And I went into his office in the ministry.So I cover global health for The Times. And I am meant to travel the world, although, obviously, the last couple of years, that has not been a thing.And told him why I was in Sierra Leone.I would love to hear from you how it’s been going and what the challenges are.Yeah, so thank you very much. And by the way—And he told me about how he used to work for the C.D.C. in the United States. And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister.I was appointed on the 10th of February last year.And that was peak pandemic. So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point. But also—And on the 14th, Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak.—just a couple of days after Dr. Demby came back to take up this job, an Ebola outbreak was declared.Oh, wow.So this is a guy who really knows a thing or two about pandemics.The lessons learned from Ebola are extremely helpful. I mean—And we started off by talking a little bit about 2014, ‘15, ‘16, when that last really terrible Ebola outbreak, you might remember, went through this region. 11,000 people died. It was really devastating for Sierra Leone.When we had Ebola here, people knew what hand-sanitizing was. People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever, social distancing. People knew about care.And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid.So that gives us a headstart. And what that meant was Sierra Leone was the last country in Africa to report a case. And Sierra Leone has constantly reported very, very low numbers throughout all of this outbreak.And when I started asking Dr. Demby about Covid, he attributed some of their low case numbers to the fact that they’d been able to very quickly mount a strong response.But then how does Dr. Demby explain the things that you were seeing in your reporting, Stephanie? I mean, in the regional coordinator’s office, in the hospital, this fact that people didn’t seem to be doing any testing.Right, so I asked him about that.Can I ask you about that? Because it’s quite extraordinary for me to come— I live in Canada— and to travel from a place where people are pandemic obsessed, right, to a place where it’s clearly not on people’s minds. How confident are you in your surveillance?I said, what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here? How much are you testing? How much are you looking?So that’s a really interesting point. Again, you have to be careful with this, but I think most of the testing that’s occurring is occurring at the airport, which is more entry and exit, you know?And he acknowledged freely that there’s very little testing happening.And so when we say we have silent districts, they’re silent either because there are no cases or because we’re not testing them, yeah? But I have a feeling that there’s a lot of transmission going on in here.So it sounds like the health minister of Sierra Leone is confirming the theory that cases are being severely undercounted.Yeah, definitely.There was a survey that was done a while back that indicated close to 50 percent of people have been exposed.Do you believe it?Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is a study that was done by Tulane.And in fact, he told me about some recent research that had looked for antibody levels in the population and had found that probably half the people in Sierra Leone when that study was done had already been exposed to Covid.I think we’re looking at doing another survey now to look at the antibody levels in the country. But I would not be surprised if it’s very, very high.And Stephanie, is there other data to back that up?Well, there is, actually. There’s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two-thirds of people across sub-Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies. There’s other data sources, looking particularly at West Africa, that show that 75 percent of people have got Covid antibodies. And remember, when these studies were done, only 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent of people had had access to vaccination. So if you’ve got antibodies, it’s because you had an infection.So that kind of answers your original question, right? Clearly, a lot of people in Sierra Leone did have Covid.Yeah, absolutely. And in fact, Dr. Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation. They know lots of people have been infected.However, I’m buoyed by the fact that no matter what there is, there’s no evident excess deaths that are occurring that’s very visible.But he also talked about something else they’re seeing— or actually, what they’re not seeing. He was just totally adamant that they’re not seeing the death rates that we’ve seen in other parts of the world.Everybody else, there are multiple waves in Italy now, in Germany, everywhere else. People are still dying in the U.S. But when you look here, you see that people are still getting sick. We’re still getting cases. But you don’t get the kind of enormity that others are seeing.And remember, Sierra Leone has this surveillance system that’s a legacy of that terrible Ebola outbreak.The thing is we also have a very active surveillance system. Every week, we got reports of all of the deaths around.And he says, look, if there was a spike in deaths in one region of this country anywhere, we would know about it, and it’s just not happening.We haven’t seen any excess mortality that could alert us that there’s something going on.Hmm. Interesting. So it sounds like, Stephanie, from what you’re saying, Sierra Leone and a lot of sub-Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic. But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies, had Covid. And if we follow what happened in the U.S., they should have a lot of deaths, right? But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died.Well, so there I am with a whole new mystery, right? If lots of people have Covid, but they don’t have deaths to report, what’s going on?We’ll be right back.So, Stephanie, how did you go about digging into this other part of the mystery, which had to do with how many people in Sierra Leone actually died of Covid?So I started calling up epidemiologists in all different parts of sub-Saharan Africa, people I’ve known for a long while. And I started asking them this question of, what do you think is happening? And after a lot of conversations, I kind of was left with two really different theories that would explain how even though we know there are lots of Covid infections in Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, how it could be that people don’t seem to be dying.And what are those theories? Lay those out for me.Well, the first one is that there is no mystery. There’s just lousy data on deaths. There’s not some miraculous thing happening in West and Central Africa or in regions that report lower Covid deaths. The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them. And the second theory is that, in fact, there’s no way that thousands and millions of deaths have been missed. Something else is protecting people. Something else is going on that means people are getting infected with Covid, but they don’t get sick or they don’t die at the same rates.OK, so let’s start with the first theory because that one seems pretty logical to me. I mean, if it’s clear that cases were being undercounted, then probably deaths were being undercounted, right?Yeah, I think this is a really strong argument. We know that death registration in much of sub-Saharan Africa is really, really poorly done. There are a lot of countries where only 5% or 6% of deaths are ever registered with a civil authority.Oh, wow.People don’t typically die in medical facilities or hospitals. They most often will die at home. And they get buried in a small village graveyard. And so that death never gets reported. An excellent Zambian public health researcher I spoke to told me about a study he’s been doing that found that nearly 90% of the bodies in the main morgue in Zambia were positive for Covid.This was at the height of the Delta wave. And he said, look, there’s just no reason to think that fewer Zambians would be dying or Ethiopians or Sierra Leoneans, right? There’s no inherent reason why there would be fewer deaths here, just the record keeping is really weak.And there’s a model that draws together lots and lots of different data sets that the economist has been running that says there could be up to three million Covid excess deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.Oh, wow. So three million deaths that basically have been uncounted.That’s the argument. Now, look, to be clear, that model says the deaths have been undercounted all over the world. We know that that’s true. But according to this model, the problem of undercounting is the most severe in Africa.And does that hold water?Well, a lot of people that I spoke to say there’s no question some deaths have been missed, but they’re really not buying it. And that includes the chief of the Covid response for the W.H.O., the World Health Organization in sub-Saharan Africa. He said to me there’s just no way, there’s just no way that we have missed millions of deaths. Models are useful to a point, but there are lots of other ways of seeing deaths, right?When Zambia had a bad Delta wave, there were bodies stacked outside the morgue. I mean, a place like Sierra Leone holds really, really big funerals. People say there’s just no way that there could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths and that we’ve just missed them.And Stephanie, if it were true that there were high case numbers, but low deaths from Covid in Sierra Leone, what would explain that?Well, that is an excellent question. So, again, there are lots of theories. The leading one— and I think that whatever else is true, this is a part of it— is age, right? Sub-Saharan Africa has a median age of 19, right? Sierra Leone is right around that as well. And that compares with 43 in Europe, 38 in the United States. And so we know that Covid is much more deadly for older people who have lived long enough to have developed the co-morbidities, such as diabetes, that makes Covid really deadly. The virus is far less likely to kill young people. And they’re often asymptomatic altogether.Another argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with temperature, the fact that it’s, obviously, really quite warm in all of these countries, and people mostly live their life outdoors. Obviously, if you’re talking about people who are in Sierra Leone, primarily subsistence farmers spending the day in their fields, they’re not getting exposed to Covid the way they would on a crowded subway train, although, of course, now we know that huge numbers of people actually have been infected. So that theory is a bit questionable.And then finally, the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid, or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone, you’ve had repeated bouts of malaria. You’ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease, that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid.Hmm. That’s interesting. And how do these three factors hold up when you compare Sierra Leone to another similar country that had a really bad time with Covid?Well, we can talk about India. India has reported half a million Covid deaths, but it’s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to 4 million people who’ve died of the virus. So India also has a young population, right? There, the median age is about 28. It’s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors. And there’s regions of India that have very high rates of infection with malaria. There are lots of other pathogens in circulation, so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things.So we know that those factors were not protective in India. On the other hand, India is a much more dense place. It’s much more connected. It has much better transportation. So it’s not a straight comparison to Sierra Leone, but it’s enough to suggest that those three things alone don’t cover it as an explanation.So it sounds like what India is showing us is that these factors you’re talking about, they’re all playing something of a role, but there’s not a single one of them that solves the mystery entirely.Yeah, that’s exactly right.So I’m wondering, Stephanie, in all the reporting you’ve done, how do you even begin to figure out what’s true? I mean, is it that Covid deaths in Africa are really being undercounted, or that Africans have this really unique immunity to Covid?Where I wound up is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. If you’re in a place like Sierra Leone that has incredibly high infant mortality— it has the highest maternal mortality in the world. Thousands of people die of malaria. There is all kinds of other infectious diseases that people are prey to. It is possible that Covid could cause a rise in the number of deaths that wouldn’t necessarily show up the way it would in a country with overall lower mortality figures.On the other hand, I believe people in Sierra Leone when they say to me, there have been no extra deaths in my village this year. One person died, two people died. It’s just like all the other years. Nothing unusual has happened here.Right.What I can also tell you is that I was able to sit down and read all of the serious research on the topic in a single morning. It’s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters, right? It matters for Sierra Leone, for sub-Saharan Africa, but it also matters to everybody else.What are the stakes, Stephanie? Why does it matter?Well, it matters for a couple of reasons. In terms of why it matters for the world, if there is something going on that means people really aren’t getting sick with Covid or aren’t dying from Covid at the same rate in West and Central Africa, in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, understanding where that protection, where that immunity is coming from, that could help us in lots of ways. It could help develop better treatments. It could help with another generation of vaccines.So it matters for protecting the world, but it also matters for sub-Saharan Africa, for Sierra Leone. There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate 70 percent of people. And Sierra Leone is scrambling to do that.Well, you have now a situation where COVAX came through. The World Bank came through with funding that allowed us to buy about $4 million worth of vaccines.When I spoke to the health minister, Dr. Demby, he was talking about how there’s a lot of resources coming into the country right now to do Covid vaccination. But—At the same time we have the Ebola vaccination going on, there was a polio outbreak. So all of this was going on at the same time. The same staff was doing all of this.That is an enormous challenge in a place like Sierra Leone with a health system that was already really struggling to respond to what people needed.And not only that, you had to raise awareness, bring people in, and vaccinate them.And then trying to convince young healthy people to get a shot for a disease that, as we’ve just been talking about, they really don’t think as a risk to them.It becomes a real burden when people are not sick.So it sounds like there’s this tension here, right? I mean, public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate 70 percent of Africa. But Dr. Demby is finding that that’s a really complicated thing to do, and especially complicated when it’s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country.I think there’s a growing— it started as a whisper and then a mutter, and now it’s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa makes sense, whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources.My responsibility is, how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid, but at the same time, be a resource for rebuilding health systems?I think all things being equal, Dr. Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn’t killing people now, the next variant might be deadly. But—The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long.He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system, he’s facing these trade-offs. I would say there are artificial trade-offs between addressing one disease or another. And so he’s in this position where he’s having to really ask himself, what should he do with the limited resources that he has?Stephanie, thank you.It’s a pleasure.We’ll be right back.Here’s what else you need to know today.On Wednesday, in response to atrocities in the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies moved to impose full sanctions against Russia’s largest financial institutions.The Biden administration, together with the European Union, imposed strict sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, which holds over a third of the country’s financial assets, and Alfa-Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks. The administration also announced that it would block access to U.S.-held financial assets for family members and close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Putin’s two adult daughters.And Pentagon officials said that Russia has withdrawn all of its troops from the territory around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Chernihiv, a major city in the north. Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago, but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self-proclaimed pullout could be a ruse. As many as 40,000 Russian troops have now left the territory and are rearming and resupplying before launching what Western officials believe will be a renewed focus on Ukraine’s east and south.Meanwhile, a video posted online and verified by The New York Times appears to show Ukrainian mistreatment of Russian prisoners. In the video, a Russian soldier can be seen with a jacket pulled over his head, gasping for air, before he is shot by a Ukrainian soldier. At least three other men believed to be Russian soldiers lay dead beside him, one with his hands tied behind his back.Today’s episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja, Rikki Novetsky and Rob Szypko, with help from Michael Symon Johnson.

This is The Daily.Throughout the pandemic, as countries have struggled with disease and death, one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared— Central and Western Africa. My colleague, Stephanie Nolen, traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic.It’s Thursday, April 7.So, Stephanie, you’re a global health reporter at The Times. Tell me about the kind of reporting that you’ve been doing during the pandemic.So, generally, a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world, things like infectious disease, malaria, tuberculosis, H.I.V. But of course, in the Covid era, that’s mostly meant reporting on Covid. And I’ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world. And in February, I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries, and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven’t paid as much attention to in the pandemic.So I arrived in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, at what was the height of the Omicron wave. And I was coming from Canada, which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic. And I hired a vehicle with a driver, and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests. And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there, and it was really startling.We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying. There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it. Nobody had a mask on. And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people, are you worried about Covid? I mean, they knew what I was talking about, but they couldn’t fathom why I would be concerned. It was like time travel back to 2019, like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow.And right away, I thought, I need to understand what’s happening here. Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here? Or it is here, but it’s not making people sick? It’s not killing people? And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months, this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa, but until I saw it, I really didn’t understand just how puzzling this was. And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery.Stephanie, to that point, what’s the big picture here? I mean, tell me what’s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic. Catch me up on how it’s played out.So I’ll start with South Africa because that’s the country in sub-Saharan Africa that we know the most about. So South Africa, of course, has had a pretty rough time. The Beta variant was first identified there. The Omicron variant was first identified there. They’ve caused bad waves. We know that there have been probably 300,000 deaths caused by Covid in South Africa.As you move through the continent, it gets murkier. East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya, Uganda. There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full. But they’re rare stories. And as you move into Central and then Western Africa, there have been even fewer reports like this, right? Much, much lower reports of deaths. Sierra Leone is a country of 8 million people, and they’ve reported a total of 7,700 Covid cases and just 125 deaths.That seems incredibly low.It really is.So how did you start to answer that question, Stephanie? The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid. What did you do first?So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases. And the town that I was in, Kamakwie, happened to have the regional Covid coordinator’s office there. So I went across town and walked into the office.And it was completely empty, except for the district coordinator, the Covid coordinator, who I found sitting behind his desk, all alone in an otherwise completely empty office. He had a shiny new laptop in front of him, but no internet connection and, indeed, no power. And when I asked him what he knew about cases, he told me really proudly that they’d only had 11 since the start of the pandemic.Oh, wow, 11 for roughly what kind of population?Oh, it’s about 125,000 people in this district.Wow.So that was kind of shocking. But then the question was, well, how do you know? So I asked him what was happening with testing. And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital. So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital, thinking, OK, maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing.This is the hospital of the same region?It’s the district hospital serving those 125,000 people. And there was a lab, and there were three busy technicians in that lab. And when I said, what are you doing in terms of Covid testing, they were pretty blunt. There’s not a lot of resources in this hospital. So what they do when people come in is they triage. They test first for malaria. And if you don’t have malaria, they’ll test you for typhoid. And if you don’t have typhoid, then they’ll test you for Covid. And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point, they figured out what they have.So, Stephanie, it sounds like from your reporting what you’re finding is that, number one, the regional coordinator is not doing the testing. And number two, at the hospital, they have so many other urgent diseases, malaria, for example, that Covid is just really the last thing on their list.Exactly. There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country. So I went back down south to Freetown, to the capital. And I went to see Dr. Austin Demby, who is the health minister of Sierra Leone. And I went into his office in the ministry.So I cover global health for The Times. And I am meant to travel the world, although, obviously, the last couple of years, that has not been a thing.And told him why I was in Sierra Leone.I would love to hear from you how it’s been going and what the challenges are.Yeah, so thank you very much. And by the way—And he told me about how he used to work for the C.D.C. in the United States. And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister.I was appointed on the 10th of February last year.And that was peak pandemic. So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point. But also—And on the 14th, Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak.—just a couple of days after Dr. Demby came back to take up this job, an Ebola outbreak was declared.Oh, wow.So this is a guy who really knows a thing or two about pandemics.The lessons learned from Ebola are extremely helpful. I mean—And we started off by talking a little bit about 2014, ‘15, ‘16, when that last really terrible Ebola outbreak, you might remember, went through this region. 11,000 people died. It was really devastating for Sierra Leone.When we had Ebola here, people knew what hand-sanitizing was. People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever, social distancing. People knew about care.And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid.So that gives us a headstart. And what that meant was Sierra Leone was the last country in Africa to report a case. And Sierra Leone has constantly reported very, very low numbers throughout all of this outbreak.And when I started asking Dr. Demby about Covid, he attributed some of their low case numbers to the fact that they’d been able to very quickly mount a strong response.But then how does Dr. Demby explain the things that you were seeing in your reporting, Stephanie? I mean, in the regional coordinator’s office, in the hospital, this fact that people didn’t seem to be doing any testing.Right, so I asked him about that.Can I ask you about that? Because it’s quite extraordinary for me to come— I live in Canada— and to travel from a place where people are pandemic obsessed, right, to a place where it’s clearly not on people’s minds. How confident are you in your surveillance?I said, what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here? How much are you testing? How much are you looking?So that’s a really interesting point. Again, you have to be careful with this, but I think most of the testing that’s occurring is occurring at the airport, which is more entry and exit, you know?And he acknowledged freely that there’s very little testing happening.And so when we say we have silent districts, they’re silent either because there are no cases or because we’re not testing them, yeah? But I have a feeling that there’s a lot of transmission going on in here.So it sounds like the health minister of Sierra Leone is confirming the theory that cases are being severely undercounted.Yeah, definitely.There was a survey that was done a while back that indicated close to 50 percent of people have been exposed.Do you believe it?Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is a study that was done by Tulane.And in fact, he told me about some recent research that had looked for antibody levels in the population and had found that probably half the people in Sierra Leone when that study was done had already been exposed to Covid.I think we’re looking at doing another survey now to look at the antibody levels in the country. But I would not be surprised if it’s very, very high.And Stephanie, is there other data to back that up?Well, there is, actually. There’s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two-thirds of people across sub-Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies. There’s other data sources, looking particularly at West Africa, that show that 75 percent of people have got Covid antibodies. And remember, when these studies were done, only 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent of people had had access to vaccination. So if you’ve got antibodies, it’s because you had an infection.So that kind of answers your original question, right? Clearly, a lot of people in Sierra Leone did have Covid.Yeah, absolutely. And in fact, Dr. Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation. They know lots of people have been infected.However, I’m buoyed by the fact that no matter what there is, there’s no evident excess deaths that are occurring that’s very visible.But he also talked about something else they’re seeing— or actually, what they’re not seeing. He was just totally adamant that they’re not seeing the death rates that we’ve seen in other parts of the world.Everybody else, there are multiple waves in Italy now, in Germany, everywhere else. People are still dying in the U.S. But when you look here, you see that people are still getting sick. We’re still getting cases. But you don’t get the kind of enormity that others are seeing.And remember, Sierra Leone has this surveillance system that’s a legacy of that terrible Ebola outbreak.The thing is we also have a very active surveillance system. Every week, we got reports of all of the deaths around.And he says, look, if there was a spike in deaths in one region of this country anywhere, we would know about it, and it’s just not happening.We haven’t seen any excess mortality that could alert us that there’s something going on.Hmm. Interesting. So it sounds like, Stephanie, from what you’re saying, Sierra Leone and a lot of sub-Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic. But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies, had Covid. And if we follow what happened in the U.S., they should have a lot of deaths, right? But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died.Well, so there I am with a whole new mystery, right? If lots of people have Covid, but they don’t have deaths to report, what’s going on?We’ll be right back.So, Stephanie, how did you go about digging into this other part of the mystery, which had to do with how many people in Sierra Leone actually died of Covid?So I started calling up epidemiologists in all different parts of sub-Saharan Africa, people I’ve known for a long while. And I started asking them this question of, what do you think is happening? And after a lot of conversations, I kind of was left with two really different theories that would explain how even though we know there are lots of Covid infections in Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, how it could be that people don’t seem to be dying.And what are those theories? Lay those out for me.Well, the first one is that there is no mystery. There’s just lousy data on deaths. There’s not some miraculous thing happening in West and Central Africa or in regions that report lower Covid deaths. The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them. And the second theory is that, in fact, there’s no way that thousands and millions of deaths have been missed. Something else is protecting people. Something else is going on that means people are getting infected with Covid, but they don’t get sick or they don’t die at the same rates.OK, so let’s start with the first theory because that one seems pretty logical to me.

But Dr. Demby is finding that that’s a really complicated thing to do, and especially complicated when it’s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country.I think there’s a growing— it started as a whisper and then a mutter, and now it’s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa makes sense, whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources.My responsibility is, how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid, but at the same time, be a resource for rebuilding health systems?I think all things being equal, Dr. Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn’t killing people now, the next variant might be deadly. But—The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long.He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system, he’s facing these trade-offs. I would say there are artificial trade-offs between addressing one disease or another. And so he’s in this position where he’s having to really ask himself, what should he do with the limited resources that he has?Stephanie, thank you.It’s a pleasure.We’ll be right back.Here’s what else you need to know today.On Wednesday, in response to atrocities in the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies moved to impose full sanctions against Russia’s largest financial institutions.The Biden administration, together with the European Union, imposed strict sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, which holds over a third of the country’s financial assets, and Alfa-Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks. The administration also announced that it would block access to U.S.-held financial assets for family members and close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Putin’s two adult daughters.And Pentagon officials said that Russia has withdrawn all of its troops from the territory around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Chernihiv, a major city in the north. Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago, but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self-proclaimed pullout could be a ruse. As many as 40,000 Russian troops have now left the territory and are rearming and resupplying before launching what Western officials believe will be a renewed focus on Ukraine’s east and south.Meanwhile, a video posted online and verified by The New York Times appears to show Ukrainian mistreatment of Russian prisoners. In the video, a Russian soldier can be seen with a jacket pulled over his head, gasping for air, before he is shot by a Ukrainian soldier. At least three other men believed to be Russian soldiers lay dead beside him, one with his hands tied behind his back.Today’s episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja, Rikki Novetsky and Rob Szypko, with help from Michael Symon Johnson.

But nations in the center and west of the continent appear to have been largely spared. Sierra Leone, for example, has reported a total of 7,700 cases and 125 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.What is behind these low case and death rates — and what does that tell us about the future of the pandemic?Stephanie Nolen, a global health reporter for The New York Times.The coronavirus was expected to devastate Africa, but higher-income and better-prepared countries appear to have fared far worse.There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily.

The three people who died had not been vaccinated against covid-19, according to NPR. The last reported covid-19 death in the city was April 8, 2020.Shanghai reported 22,248 new local infections on Monday, according to China’s National Health Commission, by far the worst outbreak in all of China right now. The vast majority of those infections were asymptomatic. Mainland China reported 1,104 new local infections outside of Shanghai on Monday.Residents of Shanghai have struggled with this most recent lockdown, which started in late March. Viral videos have emerged showing health workers beating residents for allegedly violating covid protocols and unconfirmed reports have even claimed pets of people who test positive have been killed.China’s government has pursued the controversial goal of completely eliminating covid-19 from the country, rather than allowing it to circulate through the country. And while the strategy has likely saved millions of lives since the start of the pandemic, it’s a draconian policy that has severely impeded people’s ability to move freely.The U.S. reported 8,099 new cases on Sunday, a vast undercount given that just four of the 50 states reported their numbers on the Easter holiday. The U.S. is currently averaging 36,698 new cases per day, a number that itself is likely artificially low due to the vast number of people who test positive with home testing and don’t report the results to their local health commission. The U.S. is averaging 447 new deaths from covid-19 each day.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.The U.S. has reported over 80.5 million covid-19 cases since the pandemic started in early 2020 and over 987,000 deaths.

But herd immunity looks likely to remain elusive, and many people are still at high risk from Covid-19.What do the C.D.C. figures mean for immunity in the United States, and for the future of the pandemic?Apoorva Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter for The New York Times.Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations.There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily.

The U.S. State Department ordered some workers to leave Shanghai.As U.S. cases tick up, the new White House Covid czar says it’s not a moment to be ‘excessively concerned.’The U.S. State Department orders nonemergency workers and their families to leave Shanghai.The city of Philadelphia will reinstate an indoor mask mandate, the first major U.S. city to do so this spring.Virus outbreaks are pushing some U.S. universities to reinstate mask mandates.The Boston Symphony cancels its European tour over virus concerns.‘We cannot let our guard down,’ a top Chinese health official tells people under lockdown.The new White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr. Ashish K. Jha, said Monday that while there had been a recent uptick in new U.S. coronavirus cases, he was not overly concerned.“We’ve got to watch this very carefully — obviously, I never like to see infections rising — I think we’ve got to be careful,” Dr. Jha said on the “Today” show. “But I don’t think this is a moment where we have to be excessively concerned.”Dr. Jha, a public health expert, made several media appearances on Monday, his first official day according to the White House, and he pointed to low hospitalization numbers across the United States. The vast majority of the country has low community levels of Covid-19, according to calculations performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are designed to assess the number of new cases in a community and the strain on its hospitals, a point also made on Sunday by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s top pandemic adviser.“Right now that is showing an uptick, but not showing substantial changes in what we should be doing,” Dr. Jha said on CNN, referring to the C.D.C. framework. “And I think the C.D.C. policy is right on this.”And while he praised the role of at-home tests, Dr. Jha acknowledged many of those results may go unreported, underpinning, he said, the importance of hospitalizations as a metric.Dr. Jha’s tenure begins as a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2, has become the dominant version among new U.S. cases. As of Sunday, the United States was averaging more than 31,000 cases a day, an increase of 3 percent over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database, just a fraction of the height of the Omicron winter surge.Still, New York City and Washington, D.C., are among the places seeing steeper increases than the nation overall, though their average numbers of new cases remain far lower than recent peaks, too. Prominent officials in both cities, such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mayor Eric Adams of New York, have tested positive in recent days, as have some Broadway stars.On Monday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said that both Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had tested negative in the last 24 hours. Ms. Harris had been considered a close contact of her communications director, who tested positive last week, but the vice president was now five days post-exposure, Ms. Psaki said.A handful of colleges and universities in the country have reinstated mask mandates as they battle outbreaks on campus. On Monday, the city of Philadelphia announced it would soon reinstate an indoor mask mandate.This chart shows how reported cases per capita have changed in different parts of the country. The state with the highest recent cases per capita is shown.And after the Gridiron Club and Foundation’s annual dinner in Washington on April 2, at least 80 attendees tested positive, Tom DeFrank, a contributing editor for National Journal and president of the Gridiron Club, said in an email on Monday afternoon. The number of new cases reported each day has been declining, he said, adding that reported symptoms remain mild, with several asymptomatic cases.“Now that we are nine days after the dinner, the connection between a new positive test and our dinner is certainly arguable, particularly for public officials who have had a full week of public events,” Mr. DeFrank said in a statement.“What it reminds us is the pandemic isn’t over,” Dr. Jha said on “Good Morning America,” referring to the number of cases after the Gridiron dinner, which included some Cabinet members. “We are still going to see cases of this virus spreading. And we have to continue to be vigilant. We have to continue to be careful.”Neither Mr. Biden nor Ms. Pelosi attended the Gridiron dinner, and Ms. Pelosi said on Monday that she would be leaving isolation on Tuesday after testing negative on Monday.Elsewhere in the House, Representative Rashida Tlaib said on Monday she had tested positive. In Connecticut, the lieutenant governor, Susan Bysiewicz, said she tested positive, too.Dr. Jha also told the “Today” show that the C.D.C. would get the final say on the future of the mask mandate on airplanes and other public transportation — but said that extending the requirement, which currently goes through at least April 18, “is absolutely on the table.”Dr. Jha replaced Jeffrey D. Zients, who left the position to return to his private life, according to the White House. Mr. Zients, an entrepreneur and management consultant, steered the White House response and U.S. vaccination campaign through multiple variants.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.— Giulia Heyward and Alexandra E. Petri The U.S. State Department said on Monday that it had ordered all nonemergency U.S. consulate employees and their families to leave Shanghai as a lockdown aimed at containing a surge in Omicron coronavirus cases stretched into its second week.China’s “zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19,” the travel advisory issued on Monday said, “severely impacts travel and access to public services.”The move came after the department had, on Friday, authorized those individuals to depart the area, adding that Americans should avoid traveling to China because of its “arbitrary enforcement of local laws and Covid-19 related restrictions.”“The movement from ‘authorized’ to ‘ordered’ departure means that we are now mandating that certain employees depart Shanghai rather than making this decision voluntary,” the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China said in a statement, adding that the employees and families will depart on commercial flights.“Our change in posture reflects our assessment that it is best for our employees and their families to be reduced in number and our operations to be scaled down,” the agency said.The American Citizen Services Unit, as the consular services office of the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai is known, has been closed since March 30, the agency said.Under a lockdown that began on April 1, residents of Shanghai, a city of 25 million people, have struggled to arrange food deliveries. Some residents have shouted out their windows, demanding to be given supplies. Shanghai recorded about 26,100 new symptomatic and asymptomatic cases on Sunday, China’s National Health Commission said on Monday, accounting for more than 94 percent of about 27,500 cases that the health authorities recorded throughout mainland China.The State Department has advised Americans not to travel to Hong Kong because of the restrictions imposed by the city under the direction of the central Chinese government, as the Chinese territory has struggled to contain the wave of cases there.In both Shanghai and Hong Kong, the department said, some children had been separated from their parents to be quarantined or isolated, although the Shanghai government has begun allowing children with special needs to quarantine with their families.The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, declined to say on Monday afternoon whether any American families had been separated by quarantine orders in Shanghai. Alexandra Stevenson and Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.— John Yoon With new coronavirus cases low but rising sharply in recent days, the city of Philadelphia announced on Monday that it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate a little more than a month after lifting it, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so.“This is our chance to get ahead of the pandemic,” said Cheryl Bettigole, the city’s health commissioner, in a news conference. She acknowledged that the average number of daily new cases, currently at 142, is still nowhere near what it was at the beginning of the year, when the Omicron variant was pushing the seven-day average to nearly 4,000.But she said that if the city failed to require masks now, “knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations, and then a wave of deaths, then it will be too late for many of our residents.” Over the past week, the city reported that the number of residents who had died of Covid-19 passed 5,000.The mandate will go into effect next week. A spokesman for the city’s health department said it would end when case numbers and rates go beneath a certain threshold.The decision comes as cases are ticking up across the country, fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2. While the national increase is so far relatively small — about 3 percent over the last two weeks — the growth in cases in Northeastern cities like New York City and Washington, D.C., has been significantly steeper. Some colleges in the Northeast, including Columbia, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, have reinstated indoor mask mandates in recent days.Speaking at a virtual news conference on Monday afternoon, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City said that he would follow the advice of his health team in making any determination on reinstating mask mandates in spite of his positive test result on Sunday, rising virus cases in the city and Philadelphia’s decision.“I am not special as being the mayor. What happens to me personally should not determine how I make policies,” Mr. Adams said. “It should be what happens to the City of New York.”“I feel fine, no fever, no running nose, no aches and pains,” the mayor said, adding that with his health history of diabetes, “I would probably have had different outcomes if I was not vaccinated and boosted.”Under Philadelphia’s Covid response plan, mitigation measures are triggered when caseloads or case trajectories pass certain thresholds. Since early March, as Omicron swiftly receded, the city had been at Level 1, or “all clear,” meaning most mandatory measures — including indoor mask mandates as well as proof-of-vaccine requirements in restaurants — had been lifted. Masks have no longer been required at city schools, though people visiting hospitals or riding public transportation still have had to wear them.The indoor mask mandate is reinstated automatically when the city rises to Level 2, in which average new daily case counts and hospitalizations are still low but “cases have increased by more than 50 percent in the previous 10 days.” The health departments spokesman said over the last 10 days case the average number of news cases had risen nearly 70 percent.Philadelphia’s system “allow us to be clear, transparent and predictable in our response to local Covid-19 conditions,” said Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement after the announcement was made. “I’m optimistic that this step will help us control the case rate,” he added.The city’s decision is at odds with the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Basing its designation on hospital admissions among other benchmarks, the C.D.C. considers Philadelphia to have a “low” community level, and thus does not advise required masking.Asked about the difference, Dr. Bettigole emphasized that “local conditions do matter” in making these decisions, and brought up the inequities in the virus’s impact. “We’ve all seen here in Philadelphia, how much our history of redlining, history of disparities has impacted, particularly our Black and brown communities in the city,” she said. “And so it does make sense to be more careful in Philadelphia, than, you know, perhaps in an affluent suburb.”Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.— Campbell Robertson A small number of U.S. colleges and universities are reinstating mask policies, citing coronavirus outbreaks on campus. The moves come at a time when the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2, has become the dominant version among new U.S. cases, which are ticking up.The nation was averaging more than 31,000 new coronavirus cases a day as of Sunday, according to a New York Times database —\\xa0 a 3 percent increase from two weeks ago. New York City and Washington, D.C., have seen sharper increases, though the figures there remain well below earlier peaks. Several prominent officials and some Broadway stars have recently tested positive. With new cases low but rising sharply in recent days, the city of Philadelphia announced on Monday that it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate a little more than a month after lifting it, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so.During the winter surge driven by another form of Omicron, the BA.1 subvariant, some universities shifted to pandemic policies aimed at living with the virus rather than trying to keep it off campus completely — policies like using quarantines and social distancing when outbreaks occur, rather than canceling in-person instruction altogether. As the numbers of new cases decreased, some colleges and universities further loosened precautions like surveillance testing programs, despite criticism from public health experts.Now, while some universities like Harvard are letting professors decide for themselves which rules to follow in their classrooms, others are imposing new campuswide mask rules:American University said on Monday that it would start requiring masks in all campus buildings, including medical facilities and the school’s shuttles, beginning on Tuesday. Professors will be able to remove their masks in classrooms while teaching.Columbia University said on Sunday that students would have to wear non-cloth masks in classrooms for the remainder of the spring semester, through May 2, “based on the current situation and in an abundance of caution.” Last week, Barnard College, a women’s undergraduate college affiliated with Columbia, reinstated its indoor mask rule.Georgetown University announced last week that masks would be required inside any campus buildings until further notice because of campus Covid outbreaks, “particularly among undergraduate students.”George Washington University said Monday that its mask mandate would return and stay in place through commencement, the school’s student newspaper reported. Officials quoted in the report cited the university’s seven-day positivity rate, which is nearing 2 percent after remaining close to 1 percent for much of the semester.Johns Hopkins University said last week that it would require masks indoors, along with twice-weekly testing of students, and noted that nearly 100 of its more than 5,000 undergraduate students had tested positive since April 1.Rice University reinstated its mask requirement for classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. Those who are unvaccinated must continue to wear a mask in other indoor areas as well.Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.— Giulia Heyward The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced on Monday that it was canceling a four-city tour of Europe because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States.The orchestra said the tour, which was to have included stops next month in Germany, Austria and France, was not feasible because of the potential for the virus to disrupt travel. The orchestra has recently reported a surge in cases among players and members of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.“Given the ongoing presence of Covid, brought home by its unfortunate impact on a significant number of our own artists, we must keep as our first priority the health and safety of everyone involved with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,” Gail Samuel, the orchestra’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. “Sadly, the only prudent and responsible course of action is, with deep regret, to cancel the European tour.”Many classical music ensembles hoped to resume global tours this year after the long hiatus brought by the pandemic. But the persistence of the Omicron variant has continued to complicate plans.The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra recently announced it was canceling a tour of Japan and South Korea in June because of concerns about the virus.Orchestra tours have been a staple of classical music going back decades, when the biggest ensembles in the United States and Europe began leading whistle-stop visits to global capitals. In those days, tours served not just artistic purposes but also commercial ends, giving orchestras exposure to new markets and, occasionally, lucrative sponsorships.Tours are no longer the moneymakers they used to be, except for a small number of elite ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic. But they bestow international prestige on orchestras — an attractive prospect for donors — and give ensembles an opportunity to build cohesion.Overseas trips came to a halt at the outset of the pandemic, when classical touring was one of the first industries to shut down. (At the end of January 2020, before the disruptions caused by the coronavirus were widely felt in the United States, the Boston Symphony announced that it was canceling a tour of Asia.)Other ensembles have plans to go overseas in the coming months. The New York Philharmonic is planning a residency at a festival in Usedom, Germany, next month. The Philadelphia Orchestra is planning a tour of Europe in late summer.— Javier C. Hernández To Shanghai residents who have reached the limit of their patience with a lockdown that has kept them stuck at home for two weeks, a top health official has a message: “We cannot let our guard down.”Despite reports that the shutdown of daily life in Shanghai has caused food shortages and reduced access to medical care, Liang Wannian, a senior official at China’s National Health Commission, said on Sunday that the lockdown was the best way to ensure “people first, lives first.”Under the country’s zero-Covid strategy, Shanghai and more than a dozen other cities in China are under full or partial lockdowns to tackle spikes in Omicron cases of the coronavirus. The lockdowns are exposing a growing social and economic cost of the strategy, which has been abandoned nearly everywhere else in the world.Other countries have lifted most restrictions, but “lying flat is not an option for China,” Mr. Liang said, referring to the phenomenon of “lying flat,” or relaxing, in the face of a challenge.China’s relatively low vaccination rate among older people and its limited health care resources for treating severe virus cases continue to worry officials and keep them from easing pandemic restrictions. There are around 264 million people over the age of 60 in China, and some 40 million of them have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus.Infections among this group were inevitable, Mr. Liang said, but “we have to take it seriously.” He spoke in an interview with Chinese state media.Health authorities reported 27,419 new locally transmitted cases in China on Monday, most of them in Shanghai, a city of 26 million. That case count is small compared with many countries, but the recent surge, fueled by the Omicron variant, is the biggest that China has experienced so far.China has reported more than 200,000 locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Shanghai since the current outbreak began last month, most of them mild or asymptomatic. The city has just one case that is currently categorized as “severe”; officials said the case required hospital treatment but did not elaborate. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak.Mass testing, a key part of China’s strategy to eliminate infections, has allowed health authorities to isolate patients who test positive and send them quickly to a hospital or isolation facility. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said last week that it would test all 18 million of its residents, after a small number of locally transmitted cases — fewer than 30 — were reported over the previous seven days. Officials in Shanghai announced a second round of mass testing for that city’s 25 million residents over the weekend.In the city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged, officials began on Monday to require residents wishing to use the city’s subway to have had a negative result on a nucleic acid test within the past 48 hours. Passengers must show their test result and scan a code from the specific subway car they sit in, so that authorities can keep track of exposure, according to a notice posted online by the Wuhan Metro on Monday.Though Mr. Liang indicated that China would not back down from its coronavirus strategy, authorities in Shanghai appeared to respond to a public outcry over the city’s handling of the outbreak. The vice mayor said on Saturday that the city would begin to lift lockdown measures in neighborhoods that go 14 days without a new case. On Monday, the city announced a system to categorize districts based on the number of reported positive cases in each.However, those moves will not do much to mitigate the lockdown’s larger economic impact, some economists said.“The extent of the lockdown is far more serious than people realize,” said Bo Zhuang, a China analyst at the investment firm Loomis Sayles.For most of last year, only a few cities in China were under lockdown at any one time, and the economic damage was manageable, Mr. Zhuang said. But these days, he estimated, the equivalent of around a quarter of China’s economic output is on hold.“Now we are talking about a couple of provinces under lockdown because of Omicron,” Mr. Zhuang said. “This would be a risk going forward.”The growing frustration over having daily life disrupted is another risk.When millions of people in Wuhan learned on Monday morning about the new rules imposed overnight concerning the city’s subway system, many turned to social media to complain.“Since Wuhan lifted the lockdown two years ago, it has issued the most stringent prevention and control measures,” Zhai Haichao, a writer and a businessman, wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. “It’s disturbing that we see no end of the pandemic.”— Alexandra Stevenson and Amy Chang Chien An experimental drug halved the death rate among critically ill Covid patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen and were at high risk for serious lung disease and death, the drug’s developer announced on Monday.There is a pressing need for new treatments for critically ill patients. Drugs like Paxlovid, made by Pfizer, are aimed primarily at patients who have mild or moderate disease. Other treatments administered to hospitalized patients in serious condition have shown limited effectiveness.The new drug, sabizabulin, reduced deaths among hospitalized Covid-19 patients so drastically in a clinical trial that independent safety monitors recommended stopping it early, officials at Veru Inc., the drug’s maker, said. The trial was halted on Friday.The results of that trial have not been reviewed by outside experts or published in a medical journal. Veru announced the findings at an early-morning news conference. The company’s stock soared in trading Monday following the announcement.About half of the 52 trial participants given a placebo or dummy pill along with regular care died within 60 days, an indicator of how very sick they were. But the death rate was 20 percent among the 98 participants who received sabizabulin, who were just as ill. The drug was given once a day for up to 21 days.“Sabizabulin is the first drug to demonstrate a clinically and statistically meaningful reduction in deaths in hospitalized patients,” Dr. Mitchell Steiner, chief executive of Veru, said. “This represents a big step forward.”Most Covid restrictions have been lifted in the United States after declining case numbers, but cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the world continue to be high, Dr. Steiner added. New variants are bound to emerge, and surges will follow.Close to a million Americans have died of Covid, and there are still 570 fatalities every day on average.The drug was granted so-called fast-track status by the Food and Drug Administration in January, Dr. Steiner said. The designation is intended to prompt faster development and review of new treatments that address unmet medical needs and target serious or life-threatening conditions.Dr. Steiner said the company plans to meet with the agency later this month and will be applying for emergency-use authorization for sabizabulin. An F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the agency did not confirm, deny or comment on pending applications.No safety concerns related to the drug were identified in the course of the clinical trial, company officials said.— Roni Caryn Rabin GLOBAL ROUNDUPSouth Korea is set to ease social distancing regulations this week as the number of new coronavirus cases falls, in line with a decline seen in many Asian countries with the notable exception of China.South Korea, which has a population of 52 million, saw a 29 percent decrease in new daily cases over the past week. It reported 90,928 new cases on Monday, the lowest level in nearly two months. As of Sunday, the average number of new cases was 203,313, a 41 percent decrease over the last two weeks, according to Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.The fall comes even as the authorities loosened some social distancing regulations last week, allowing businesses to open until midnight and increasing the cap on social gatherings to 10 from eight.The government is likely to take another step toward full reopening this week.“We will see by how much we can adjust social distancing regulations,” a senior health official, Son Young-rae, said at a briefing on Friday. Officials say the goal is to lift restrictions altogether, though it will still be obligatory to wear a mask indoors.South Korea received praise for its handling of the coronavirus in the early stages of the pandemic, but new cases soared to what at one point was a worldwide high of more than 600,000 per day in March, before starting to fall this month.Starting Monday, local health clinics and testing centers will no longer offer free rapid tests to the general public and will administer P.C.R. exams only to those in high-risk groups.The nation has a vaccination rate of 87 percent, while 64.2 percent of people have received a booster shot, according to government records. In all, 19,421 people have died from the virus in South Korea. China’s new daily case rate has risen by 340 percent in the last two weeks, while cases are up 5 percent in Japan over the same period.Elsewhere in the world:Spain’s science minister said on Monday that a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Hipra, a Spanish pharmaceutical company, could be put on sale as early as late May. The minister, Diana Morant, said in an interview with TV3, a television channel, that she expected the vaccine to receive a regulatory green light soon from the European Medicines Agency, and that the last stages of clinical trials had been “very good,” though she gave no details. Hipra developed the vaccine with the help of about €18 million from the Spanish government. The company has said it could produce 600 million doses by the end of the year.— Jin Yu Young and Raphael Minder Filed under:A Florida federal judge said the mask mandate was unlawfulA federal judge said Monday that the Biden administration could not require masks be worn on airplanes and public transportation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have the authority to introduce a mask mandate and did not follow the proper rules to implement a mandate, US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle wrote in the ruling. The mask mandate has been in place since January 2021. The CDC had just last week extended it through May 3rd. It had been set to expire on April 18th, the same day the judge made the ruling.Public transit was one of the last places masks were reliably required in the United States — most states and cities have dropped their mandates, although some have re-introduced mask-wearing rules indoors in the face of rising COVID-19 cases. The CDC said in February that masks were no longer needed on school buses.COVID-19 cases are ticking up across the country as highly contagious versions of the Omicron variant take over as the predominant form of the virus in circulation. The Transportation Security Administration won’t enforce mask wearing on public transportation, CNBC reports citing an unnamed administration official. The White House press secretary said the administration was still reviewing the order and the Justice Department will decide whether to appeal.

By 2070, if global temperatures continue to rise as predicted, there could be a total of 15,000 new cross-species “viral sharing events,” according to new research published today in the journal Nature. Of the at least 10,000 virus species in mammals capable of infecting humans, most are still only circulating among animals in the wild. The worry is that more of those viruses could eventually make the leap to humans, potentially sparking a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.“Ultimately, this work provides us with more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter but sicker,” Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University and co-lead author of the study, said in a call with reporters. As global temperatures rise, many species might need to migrate because the climate they’re used to living in is changing. Others might find that places that were once inhospitable — maybe they were too cold — are becoming more enticing. As they travel, they bring pathogens with them. Essentially, viruses now have more hosts with whom they can hitchhike long distances. That allows viruses to reach places and species that they otherwise wouldn’t have had access to in the past. “Even now, this process has likely been taking place, mostly unobserved and below the surface, and we need to start looking for it,” Albery said.When a virus passes from one species to another, it’s called a “spillover” event. If spillover occurs between an animal and a human being, a zoonotic disease can emerge. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it can move between humans and other animals. There’s evidence the novel coronavirus originated in bats. But it probably jumped to at least one other animal before reaching humans.The authors of the new study looked at potential changes to the geographical ranges of over 3,000 mammal species in a warming world. They also took into consideration how land use might change, say from deforestation and urban development. There could be over 300,000 “first encounters” between different kinds of animals in a future with two degrees of global warming above pre-industrial levels, the research shows. Most of those encounters would probably take place in tropical Asia and Africa. And that could lead to 15,000 transmission events in which at least one novel virus moves from one species to another. A majority of the projected viral sharing involves bats, which are unique among mammals because they can fly from continent to continent. The researchers stop short of estimating how often viruses might then hop over to humans. And not every virus that finds its way from an animal to a human triggers an epidemic. But Albery noted on the press call that when a virus jumps to a new species, it can create conditions that might help the virus evolve into one that’s “particularly well suited or well placed to make the jump into humans.” Take raccoons, which can thrive in forests, marshes, suburbs, and city centers. If those resourceful raccoons suddenly become susceptible to a new virus, they might be much more able to bring that virus into places where humans live. And since the virus has already made one leap from another kind of animal to a raccoon, then the virus has demonstrated that it’s prone to jumping between species.The new paper suggests that these trends are already underway and will be a problem even under some of the best-case scenarios for future climate change. We’re well on our way toward surpassing that two-degree threshold; the world has already warmed by over one degree. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged shortly after this research was completed, which the authors say points to the urgent need to prepare for more spillover. “We have to take that seriously as a real-time threat,” Georgetown University biologist Colin Carlson, another lead author of the study, said on the call. “We have to acknowledge that climate change is going to be the biggest upstream driver of disease emergence. And we have to build health systems that are ready for that.”That includes pairing surveillance of new viruses with observations of how species’ geographic ranges are shifting, the authors say. It’s part of a bigger movement to adopt a concept called One Health, which acknowledges that the health of animals, people, and the environment are all connected.Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.Chinese authorities have extended their lockdown of Shanghai to cover all its 25 million people after a fresh surge in Covid cases.Initially, there had been separate measures for the eastern and western sides, but the whole city is now subject to indefinite restrictions.Shanghai is the largest single city to be locked down to date.The important financial hub has battled a new wave of coronavirus infections for more than a month.Reported cases have risen to more than 13,000 a day, although the numbers are not high by some international standards. Residents in some areas of the city said the strict policy meant no-one was allowed to leave their housing compounds, not even to collect essential provisions.They reported difficulties in ordering food and water online, with restrictions on when customers are able to place their orders, because of a shortage of supplies and delivery staff.This country\\'s \"zero-Covid\" system is, at best, struggling to cope.China has done Covid lockdowns before, but not on the scale of its financial mega-city.The logistical challenges required to confine 25 million people to their homes, while keeping them fed, are huge. Social media here is full of angry residents complaining that they can\\'t order food because the delivery system is clogged up.Centralised isolation facilities - many using only camp beds, with no showers or other facilities - are bursting with infected people squashed in next to one another.One of China\\'s few reliable media outlets, Caixin, has reported that close contacts of infected people will be moved to neighbouring provinces. This could potentially involve hundreds of thousands of Shanghai residents.The Chinese government\\'s complete elimination strategy has become something of a mantra, with the government ridiculing other countries for sacrificing their own people on the altar of opening up.Some medical specialists here have tried to get the message through that, for a vaccinated person, catching the Omicron variant of Covid will probably not necessitate going to hospital - that you can simply ride it out at home until you recover.Few people in China seem to be aware of this. Their officials and state media have kept it from them.So the lockdowns continue and it\\'s not only Shanghai closed right now. Jilin City (3.6 million people), Changchun (nine million), Xuzhou (nine million), the steel city of Tangshan (7.7 million) and various other towns and villages are keeping their residents indoors.The strain on people, and the economic cost of it all, must be enormous.The city is testing the limits of China\\'s zero-Covid strategy, amid growing public anger over quarantine rules.The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run. \"Currently, Shanghai\\'s epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,\" said Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission. \"We must adhere to the general policy of dynamic clearance without hesitation, without wavering.\"On Monday, Shanghai reported a record 13,086 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, after a city-wide testing programme took samples from more than 25 million people in 24 hours.At least 38,000 people have been deployed to Shanghai from other regions, in what state media have said is the biggest nationwide medical operation since the shutdown of Wuhan in early 2020.Why China is locking down its citiesChina announces Shanghai lockdownOmicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?The economic cost of China\\'s zero-Covid policyRussia forced to merge depleted units in eastern Ukraine - UKUS accuses Russia of depravity and brutalityVenus and Jupiter to almost touch in night skyUkraine - the narrative the West doesn\\'t hearTaking missiles out of suburban living rooms.

The study found that long covid patients taking part in a rehabilitation program in Ireland, conducted online, experienced noticeable improvements in how their fatigue affected their well-being and daily functioning.There is much that we’re still unsure about when it comes to long covid, from its likely causes to how often it happens (estimates range from the single digits to over 25% of covid-19 cases). And we know even less about the best ways to help sufferers recover from it.There are dedicated long covid clinics in the U.S. and elsewhere, where patients might be given treatments like physical therapy, counseling, and medications to manage other conditions that could have arisen as a result, such as hypertension or diabetes. But information is sparse on how effective any of these interventions are at improving people’s symptoms or their overall quality of life. The new research, presented this week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, provides some preliminary data to that end.The pilot study included 53 people who reported covid-related fatigue severe enough to impact their daily life. About two-thirds had been dealing with their symptoms at least 12 weeks to a year after their initial covid diagnosis, while a third had been experiencing them for over a year. Nearly three-fourths also reported breathing difficulties, and about half were experiencing cognitive dysfunction, often known as brain fog.The rehab program they took part in was developed by occupational therapists at St James’s Hospital and Trinity College in Ireland and was adapted from interventions they’ve previously used to help patients with multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions. It involved three 90-minute sessions with an occupational therapist over a four-week period, delivered online at the time due to pandemic precautions. These sessions focused on stress management, sleep hygiene, and training people to recognize the daily limits of their physical and mental energy before their symptoms worsen.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.Before and after the program, patients were asked via survey about their levels of fatigue, well-being, and quality of life. By the end of the program, patients generally reported improvements in how they felt and in how their symptoms affected their lives.“Initial results from our pilot program are highly promising,” senior study author Louise Norris, an occupational therapist at St James’s Hospital in a statement from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. “They show equipping patients with a range of practical techniques can result in meaningful improvements in fatigue and quality of life. Patients also have fewer concerns about their wellbeing.”These results do come from a small sample size and have yet to be peer-reviewed, so they should be taken with added caution. The intervention also isn’t necessarily addressing the root cause of the symptoms, which may include persistent infection or an autoimmune dysfunction caused by the original infection. But it may help restore people’s ability to lead a functional life while dealing with their illness, the researchers note. And with the promising results from their pilot study now in hand, they’ve already begun to collect additional data from more patients—data that might someday show that these kinds of programs can be widely used to help patients find some semblance of normalcy again.“There is an urgent need to find new and better ways of managing post-covid fatigue and its wide-ranging, and in some cases, devastating, effects on people’s lives,” said Norris.

Now, they look like 20/20 foresight.A curbside reading room outside the Crown Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.Credit...Gregg RichardsSupported bySend any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Karrie JacobsThis article is part of our latest Design special report, about new creative pathways shaped by the pandemic.As the first winter of the pandemic drew to a close, someone in my Twitter feed enthused about an app called Libby that made it especially easy to borrow and read library books. I downloaded it, input my New York Public Library card number and proceeded to binge. I devoured everything by and about Isaac Babel, who wrote stories based on his life in early-20th-century Odessa, and all of Mick Herron’s Slough House books, about a group of sad, incompetent British spies.Libby was created by OverDrive, a Cleveland-based company that digitizes books and other publications and distributes them to 90 percent of North American libraries. The app debuted in 2017 but, no surprise, had its biggest bump in growth in 2020, a 33 percent increase in circulation compared with 2019. What distinguishes Libby from other library apps, like the New York Public Library’s SimplyE, is that it allows you to read on a Kindle (instead of, say, your phone). And it has a definite style, minimalist and sweet.Libby suggests, intentionally or not, that public libraries, the actual buildings, are no longer necessary, that libraries have become — like everything and everyone else — place-less purveyors of content. But if during the past couple of years you replaced in-person library visits with an app, you may be missing out. What many public libraries have done, despite Covid and because of it, is consciously enhance their physical presence on the street and in the neighborhood.My own heightened appreciation of the non-virtual library began one chilly evening last October. I attended a performance of excerpts from a new opera called “A Marvelous Order,” about the critic Jane Jacobs and her urban planning nemesis, Robert Moses, in essence, an opera about the value of public space. Appropriately, it was staged on the broad steps and fan-shaped plaza in front of Brooklyn’s Art Deco-style Central Library, with the composer, Judd Greenstein, conducting a small ensemble of musicians and singers and with animated graphics by Joshua Frankel projected on either side of the library’s ornate front entrance.The plaza in front of the Central Library is probably the best outdoor space in Brooklyn’s library system (which is separate from the New York Public Library system). Most of Brooklyn’s 61 libraries, including its Carnegie buildings, dating from the early 20th century, lack any kind of useful, accessible exterior space. Or so it seemed.But in January 2020, the library’s chief strategy officer, David Giles, working with a team that included Annie Barrett of BAS Architecture, embarked on a meticulous study called “Activating Exteriors,” to forge, in Ms. Barrett’s words, a “connection between a civic institution and its neighborhood.” The idea, initially, was to find ways to remove fences and other obstructions that rendered the libraries’ grounds inaccessible to the public.A few months after Covid hit, the long-term project was transformed into what Ms. Barrett called a “deployable strategy.” Said Mr. Giles, “We pushed into tactical mode.”The library decided it had to move at least some of its services outdoors. Even though the libraries were closed, the Wi-Fi was left on and, over time, the Brooklyn Public Library installed signal-boosting antennas atop most branches so that New Yorkers who lack home internet connections could have access to the web from outside. Then, at 30 or so branches, they positioned groups of cafe tables and chairs, plus the occasional book cart, wherever they would fit, on sidewalks or on narrow strips of grass.But the boldest move was the invention of the “Roadway Reading Room,” designed by Ms. Barrett and her firm, and based on the city Department of Transportation’s standards for restaurant “streeteries.” These little structures were intended to embody the gravitas associated with public libraries and also a whiff of grandeur. “We weren’t going to do things like string party lights across the sidewalk,” Ms. Barrett recalled.The elemental sheds, with distinctive, barrel-vaulted roofs, were fabricated by Bednark Studio, a firm at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, painted an eye-catching electric blue and deposited curbside in front of the Kensington, Crown Heights and Walt Whitman (Fort Greene) branches. According to Mr. Giles, the outdoor seating attracted both regular library patrons and random people looking for a spot to rest. Occasionally, police officers would use the tables to eat lunch, and, he told me, “in Brighton Beach, people would play chess.”The outdoor reading rooms were a bit neglected by the time I visited Walt Whitman in February; the chairs and tables had been removed and the structure was hemmed in by illegally parked cars. But the idea they represent — reinvention of the public library as a free-form community hub — continues to evolve. And, as it happens, this evolution is what positioned some libraries to function especially well during the pandemic.The new Greenpoint Library and Environmental Education Center, for example, funded in part by a $5 million grant from the settlement for ExxonMobil’s massive Newtown Creek oil spill, was conceived as a disseminator of environmental awareness and knowledge. When it first opened in September 2020, it could offer books only on a “grab and go” basis. But the design for its environmental mission, by the architecture firm Marble Fairbanks and landscape architecture firm SCAPE, provided an unusual amount of outdoor space, including a rooftop “reading garden” (with bleachers for the readers and shrubbery for the birds) and a second rooftop lined with planters where community members could learn to cultivate vegetables and flowers.“From the beginning we were investigating all the different ways that outdoor space would be used by the community,” said the architect Karen Fairbanks. The rooftop spaces have been well used over the past year and a half for events including evening stargazing and workshops on subjects like technology for teens and sewing.That the roof deck became a public library status symbol during a period when we could only safely gather outdoors is a happy accident. In Washington, D.C., for instance, the Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo included a spacious roof garden in its renovation plans for the central branch of the city’s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, a hard-edge 1972 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe building. Those plans were completed in 2016. The rooftop terrace, however, with its verdant landscape of wild grasses and flowers, made its public debut in September 2020. “It’s been by far the best used part of the building,” said Richard Reyes-Gavilan, executive director of the city’s libraries.The King roof deck is, at once, a place to temporarily escape the constraints of the virus and evidence of an underlying trend, Mr. Reyes-Gavilan said. “Libraries have been trying to figure out ways to make their buildings less transactional. We want people to come and stay for long periods of time to see the library as their co-working space or their third place.”Mecanoo (working with New York’s Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners) also included a roof deck in its redesign of the long-neglected Mid-Manhattan Library, now renamed (for the project’s biggest donor) the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library. On my first visit, on a warm autumn afternoon, I was astonished by the generosity of the concept: It is a public rooftop in the middle of Manhattan where you can sit quietly and read, or drink coffee (there’s a branch of Amy’s Bread), for as long as you’d like.“I would like to say that we were brilliant and foresaw Covid,” Iris Weinshall, the New York Public Library’s chief operating officer, told me. Instead the roof deck emerged from community gatherings where attendees argued for more and better meeting and event space.Mecanoo’s founding partner and creative director, Francine Houben, was offended by the American habit of wasting precious roof space on noisy HVAC systems. The architect worked with her team to devise an oddly shaped container in copper-patina green, known as the “wizard’s hat,” to hide and muffle all the machinery, thereby liberating the roof “for the people.”Of course, all of these efforts to expand the reach of the public library have been relatively modest. Elsewhere in the world, the notion that libraries are synonymous with openness has inspired bolder gestures.The most spectacular (and, arguably, most conflicted) example may be the reading room of the Beijing Sub-Center Library designed by the Norwegian firm Snohetta. Currently under construction, this indoor space encompasses more than four acres of undulating, glass-enclosed terrain supported by columns that the architects liken to ginkgo trees. Picture Zion National Park, but with tiers of bleachers rather than rock formations. “It’s really designed to be a piece of nature,” observed Snohetta’s partner, Robert Greenwood. “It’s just so big that it feels like you are out in a valley; you’re on a hillside.”As Mr. Reyes-Gavilan put it about the King Memorial Library roof deck, “When I’m up there on a warm day like today, people are so thankful that such a space exists.” Or, as Ms. Houben, who argues that every library needs a garden, suggested, “A library should be so nice that you bring your own book, right?”Karrie Jacobs is a New York-based writer specializing in architecture, design and urbanism.AdvertisementThe move is aimed at giving the C.D.C. the option of reinstating the mask mandate, if needed, after a federal judge struck down the requirement.The Biden administration says it may appeal a ruling that voided a mask mandate on public transport.Biden says Americans should decide for themselves if they want to wear masks on public transportation.Health experts express alarm at the ruling striking down the mask mandate on U.S. public transit.Experts are anxious as mask mandates fall.Masks stay required for N.Y.C. public transit, taxis and ride-share vehicles.Masks come off, to the cheers of some and concern of others.Several large U.S. transit systems have removed mask mandates.Nervous about flying? Here’s why a mask will still help protect you even if others aren’t wearing one.The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it intended to appeal a Florida judge’s ruling that struck down a federal mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation — but only if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary.The announcement from the Department of Justice came after a day of back and forth inside the White House, as administration officials faced a legal and political quandary: whether to let the judge’s ruling stand or to fight it, knowing that an appeal could result in a higher court, perhaps the Supreme Court, ruling against the administration and setting a lasting precedent that could undercut the C.D.C.’s authority.In the end, the administration charted a careful course, publicly objecting to Monday’s ruling but putting off a final decision about whether to contest it. The Justice Department and the C.D.C. “disagree with the district court’s decision and will appeal, subject to C.D.C.’s conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health,” the department said in a statement.“You are in the position of having two horrible choices,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, an expert in public health law at Georgetown University. “One choice is to risk forever taking away C.D.C.’s powers if this goes up to the 11th Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court.“And on the other hand,” he added, “if you let what I consider to be a lawless decision by this judge go forward, then C.D.C. is going to be gun-shy about doing things that it deems effective for the protection of the American public.”The mask mandate — which also applied to transportation hubs like airports and train stations, and even to ride-sharing services like Uber — had been set to expire on May 3 even before the judge struck it down on Monday.If the C.D.C. decides there is a public health basis for trying to reinstate and extend the mandate, the Justice Department will swiftly file an appeal. But if the C.D.C. decides otherwise, the administration will not appeal and the case will instead end as mooted — but without any signal of executive branch acquiescence to the judge’s view of its authority.The Justice Department “continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given C.D.C. to protect the public health,” its statement said. “That is an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve.”— Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — President Biden said on Tuesday that Americans should decide for themselves whether to wear masks, undercutting efforts by his administration to urge Americans to keep wearing face coverings on airplanes, trains and buses even after a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on public transport.The decision to wear a mask is “up to them,” Mr. Biden told reporters during a trip to New Hampshire to promote infrastructure spending.The Biden administration intends to appeal the ruling, if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary.The patchwork of messaging contributed to confusion less than 24 hours after the ruling was handed down. The president, caught somewhere between politics and science, left it up to Americans to make their own choices. His press secretary urged Americans to follow existing health guidance, because that is what the president would be doing. And Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, said on Twitter that he was disappointed in the ruling and that he, for one, would still wear masks on planes.A wave of federal agencies, city transit authorities and private companies said that they would no longer require travelers to wear masks after a federal judge appointed by former President Donald J. Trump voided a mandate on Monday that had been in place since February of last year. Just days earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended the mandate through May 3 to assess the state of the pandemic.The ruling took officials inside the White House by surprise and frustrated them, two senior officials said. But on Tuesday, as travelers aboard airplanes took directions from pilots to unmask and riders aboard transit systems, including in Washington, went mask-free, the Biden administration did not lay out a detailed plan to contest the ruling, even as public health experts warned that the C.D.C.’s authority to prevent the spread of a contagious virus was on the line.On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the decision to remove the masking decision should have been up to the C.D.C., not the courts.“Public health decisions shouldn’t be made by the courts, they should be made by public health experts,” Ms. Psaki told reporters on board Air Force One, on the way to New Hampshire. “We obviously feel confident in our authorities here given that we put the mask mandate in place and asked for 15 additional days to evaluate data based on public health information.”But the administration’s confidence in its ability to enforce masking requirements conflicted with the broader reality that many masking regulations seemed to dissolve within hours of the ruling. (Some, including in New York City, are staying in place.) The Transportation Security Administration said on Monday that it would stop enforcing the C.D.C. mandate. Several airlines, including Delta and United, told travelers that masks would not be required; some travelers learned the news midflight.Some White House officials said they would try to combat an inaccurate assessment of the threat the virus poses to the public. After Delta told its passengers that the virus had “transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus,” Kevin Munoz, a White House spokesman, tweeted that the virus was still a threat.Beyond piecemeal responses, Mr. Biden’s advisers have been trying to triage the effects of the ruling, agency by agency, to figure out what the response should be, one official said.Dr. Julie Morita, the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who served on Mr. Biden’s coronavirus advisory committee during his presidential transition, said that she hoped that the Biden administration would appeal the ruling.“It really is undermining of the C.D.C.’s public health authority to make requirements that really helps prevent disease transmission between states and internationally,” Dr. Morita said in an interview. The agency, she said, needs to “have the authority to implement these protective measures.”— Katie Rogers Many public health experts reacted with alarm to a ruling by a federal judge in Florida on Monday striking down a requirement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that passengers wear masks on buses, trains and planes.The ruling, which came less than a week after the C.D.C. had extended its order through May 3 and in the midst of a school vacation travel week, would curtail the ability of public health authorities to respond to the pandemic even as the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases rises again in the United States.Videos posted on Twitter showed air passengers flinging off their masks mid-flight and cheering after hearing announcements that the mandate had been scrapped. Some parents traveling with children too young to have been vaccinated expressed panic.Brooke Tansley, a television producer and former Broadway performer, was on a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles with her two children, a 4-year-old and an 8-month-old, when the pilot announced that masks were no longer required. “I was scared — all I could do was hope it’s going to be OK,” she said. “There wasn’t any other option.”Dr. Lakshmi Ganapathi, who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, pointed out that the ruling coincided with a recent rise in cases. “I think it’s extremely shortsighted and, if I were impolite, would say kind of stupid,” she said. “This ruling is ill-timed, and it’s not commensurate with public health principles.”She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups, including low-income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation, make them susceptible to infection, and that there is still no vaccine for very young children. Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations as protection may be overly optimistic as new variants emerge, Dr. Ganapathi said.On Jan. 29, 2021, the C.D.C. issued an order requiring people to wear masks while taking indoor public transportation and while in transportation hubs. In a statement released Tuesday, the agency said that as a result of Monday’s court ruling, the order was no longer in effect and would not be enforced, although the agency “continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time.”But even experts who had previously spoken out in favor of lifting the government mask mandate for passengers said they were troubled by the precedent that the federal judge’s ruling could set.Dr. Robert Wachter, who chairs the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and has recently said it is time to lift mask requirements, said the government needed to have the authority to issue mandates during public health crises. He called on the Biden administration to challenge the ruling.“If this becomes a precedent, that a judge can overrule government and C.D.C. experts, that puts us in a problematic place for the next surge, the next pandemic, bioterrorism or who knows,” Dr. Wachter said. “Government needs to be able to act, and to imply government does not have that authority is deeply concerning.”He noted that he would continue to wear a mask on flights and strongly encouraged his family and loved ones to do so, although he did not think the situation was sufficiently dire to justify a government mandate.“Should you wear a mask when you’re in an aluminum tube shoulder to shoulder with people for six hours?” Dr. Wachter said. “I think you should, and I will.”The same argument applied on trains and buses, he said: “My general feeling is that there is still enough virus around that I think it’s prudent to wear a mask in tight indoor spaces when you’re not sure of the vaccine status of the people around you and there’s a fair amount of virus in the community.”Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist who expressed concerns about lifting the mandate, said on Twitter on Tuesday that when it comes to air travel, “removing masking requirements is a great way to ensure you’re spreading Covid among a lot of people going to a lot of different regions.”Victoria Kim contributed reporting.— Roni Caryn Rabin Public health experts reacted with dismay to a federal judge’s ruling on Monday that struck down a mask requirement for plane, bus and train passengers, expressing concern that the case would set a precedent that erodes the authority of public health agencies and hampers their ability to respond to health emergencies.The Florida judge’s ruling was issued less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control had extended its mask order through May 3. The ruling also came in the middle of a school vacation that coincides with several major religious holidays, when many families are traveling to see relatives, some for the first time in two years.Many airplane passengers flung their masks off and cheered when pilots made announcements saying that the rule was no longer in effect. Others who have disabilities, are immunocompromised or were traveling with children too young to be vaccinated were caught off-guard and distressed that the rules were changed literally mid-flight.“If this ruling stands, it could put the American public at great risk,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president and chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the C.D.C. He added that his concerns were less to do with the immediate consequences for mask mandates than with “the implications for future crises, of the ability to put in place simple public health measures to keep people safe.”Dr. Lakshmi Ganapathi, who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, pointed out that the ruling coincides with a recent rise in Covid cases nationally, driven by a rise in cases on the East Coast.She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups, including low-income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation, make them susceptible to infection, and there is still no vaccine for very young children. Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations for protection may be overly optimistic, as emerging new variants could evade immunity, she said.Moreover, the widespread use of home testing kits, the results of which go unreported, means that official case counts do not reflect the true number of new cases. A rise in hospitalizations is not a reliable or timely indicator of severity either, Dr. Ganapathi said, since hospitalizations rise several weeks after cases begin to increase. “Once hospitalizations start rising, it’s baked in — you haven’t done anything to stop it,” she said. “And a proportion of those hospitalized will die.”— Roni Caryn Rabin Riders are still required to wear masks while taking public transportation in New York City, despite a federal judge in Florida’s ruling on Monday to overturn the nationwide mask mandate on planes and public transit.Major airlines across the country immediately dropped their mask requirements after the decision, moving so quickly that in some cases, masks became optional mid-flight.But as new confirmed coronavirus cases spurred by the rise of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA.2 rise around the country, leaders of New York City’s public transit network, citing public health guidance from the state, are keeping mask requirements in place.Tim Minton, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates New York’s subway, bus and commuter-rail networks, confirmed on Monday evening the mandate would remain in effect.He pointed to a March 2 decision by the New York state health commissioner laying out the protections mask-wearing offers from transmitting the virus, especially on public transportation.The M.T.A. falls under state control, and Gov. Kathy Hochul voiced her support for keeping the mandate on Tuesday, while also emphasizing the importance of vaccinations and regular testing.“Do your part to keep your neighbors safe,” she wrote on Twitter.The city’s Taxi & Limousine Commission, which oversees taxis and for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts, said on Tuesday that drivers and riders in those vehicles would continue to be required to wear masks as well.Uber had said on Tuesday that it would stop requiring masks in the United States. Lyft followed with a similar announcement, but both companies said local regulations would supersede their own rules.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major airports in the New York metropolitan area as well as interstate buses and bus terminals, said it would follow the local guidance in each state. Mask mandates remain in effect on the interstate PATH system and in two of the area’s three airports, Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia, which are both in New York City.But in neighboring New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy ended the mask mandate for New Jersey Transit and facilities operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority, including the Atlantic City International Airport. Masks will also no longer be required at Newark Liberty International Airport, the third major airport operated by the Port Authority, or at airports in Connecticut.Several health experts urged caution about rolling back mask mandates on public transport. Dr. Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne disease transmission, said although the city’s subway system has good air filtration and ventilation systems, those tools are no match for crowded buses or trains packed shoulder-to-shoulder with riders.— Ashley Wong and Ana Ley In the wake of a judge’s ruling on Monday that struck down a federal mandate, it is now up to each individual to decide whether to wear a mask on most commercial flights in the United States.Some people were glad to say good riddance to an inconvenience that they thought did little good and was no longer necessary. But quite a few said in interviews on Tuesday that they would stick with masks for now, even though they no longer had to.Candice Bailey, 51, was one of the holdouts. “Just to protect myself and to protect others, I continue to wear a mask,” Ms. Bailey said Tuesday morning at the airport in New Orleans as she waited to board a flight home to Greensboro, N.C. She said it was much too soon to know whether it was safe to set masks aside, especially “with the new variants that keep popping up.”With most travelers at the airport exposing their faces, Rachel Gordon, a 29-year-old science writer from Cambridge, Mass., acknowledged that she was bucking the trend. “I tend to be an outlier, because I do favor more conservative masking rules than my peers,” she said.Ms. Gordon said that she did so out of empathy for vulnerable people. When side effects from her second dose of vaccine “completely immobilized” her for a time, she said, “that gave me insight into what it might be like to get Covid without it.”Count Lois Strickland, 52, a track and field coach from Smithsburg, Md., among those who were glad to see the mandate go.“I’m tired of it, OK?” she said as she waited to board a flight to Washington. “I’ve already had Covid. I’ve already been vaccinated. I’m over it.”She noted that masks were no longer being required at many concerts and sporting events: “You don’t have to wear them there, why do we need them on public transportation?”The end of the mandate was a welcome relief for Carlos Perales, 31, a Chicago man who flew home from Florida on Tuesday with his wife, Yuliana, and two young daughters, aged 3 and 4.“It’s hard to travel with young kids and make them keep it on,” Mr. Perales said. And Abi Miller of South Bend, Ind., expressed hope that dropping the mandate would reduce the number of angry confrontations and fights on airplanes, which grew more common during the pandemic. “I figured I wouldn’t have to have my phone ready to record an incident,” she said.Samuel Oluwafemi said he found out about the end of the mandate when he landed at Salt Lake City Monday night on the first leg of his trip home to Atlanta from Honolulu. He skipped the mask for the second leg, but then put it on again as the plane neared the airport because he thought it might still be required on the ground and in the Uber car he would take home (it wasn’t).“Honestly, even now that I know, I’ll probably still wear a mask in the Uber, just to be safe,” he said. “I’m just used to it now.”Peter Shankman, 49, saw more value in mask-wearing than just Covid safety. He travels frequently for his job as a corporate keynote speaker, and he said that since he began wearing a mask on flights, he has been getting sick far less frequently.“I might continue it,” he said, adding, “It’s a little piece of fabric; it’s not that inconvenient.”For some travelers, the issue was complicated. Geoff Grubb, 44, a customer review specialist, wasn’t wearing a mask during a layover in New Orleans Tuesday, but he said he never minded wearing one.He said his 82-year-old father did mind, and had enough trouble breathing with a mask on that he avoided places that required them.Mr. Grubb said he wore a mask as he went through security at the Austin airport, but took it off at the gate where people were more spread out. If someone had asked him to, he said, he would have put it back on without complaint.“I don’t see anything in the Constitution that we have a right not to wear a mask,” he said.— Elisabeth Goodridge,\\xa0Tariro Mzezewa,\\xa0Heather Murphy,\\xa0Robert Chiarito and Patrick J. Lyons As major U.S. airlines dropped their mask mandates in response to a federal judge’s ruling, public transit systems across the country scrambled to adapt on Tuesday. New York, San Francisco and Milwaukee kept requirements in place, while systems in Atlanta, Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia allowed riders to drop their masks, as did the nationwide Amtrak rail system.In Philadelphia, the decision led to an odd juxtaposition: The city last week reinstated its mask mandate for indoor public spaces, becoming the first major U.S. city to do so this spring. But a statement late Monday announced an end to the requirement on city trains and buses, and in stations and concourses.Officials with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, wrestled with a response to the judge’s ruling. “It was a bit of a scramble,” said Andrew Busch, the Philadelphia agency’s spokesman. The overriding concern was that keeping the mask requirement would create challenges for employees charged with enforcing it, who have already faced pushback and harassment.“We wanted to try to reassure our employees that they wouldn’t be in a difficult position of trying to figure out how to tell people that this was required, when the mechanism for requiring it was no longer in place,” Mr. Busch said.Transit agencies in several other cities lifted their mandates on Tuesday, including on the Los Angeles Metro Bus and Rail system.In Boston, less than a day after the local transit agency said masks were still required on subways and buses, officials announced a reversal. Mask mandates were also lifted at Boston Logan International Airport and at most regional transit authorities across Massachusetts.After the Illinois governor amended a state mask mandate, both the Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago’s commuter rail system, Metra, announced that masks would no longer be required.Mask mandates were retained in some cities, however, including Portland’s TriMet agency and the operator of San Francisco’s city bus system and Bay Area Rapid Transit.The patchwork of responses underscored the uncertainty of the current phase of the pandemic. The Omicron subvariant known as BA.2 has reversed a nationwide decline in new cases — a trend that can be seen even with diminishing test data. But the virus is spreading in a country that is better vaccinated than during previous surges, and so far, an increase in hospitalizations has not followed the rise in infections.Even in places that have kept mask requirements, enforcement has long been virtually nonexistent on trains and buses. In Atlanta, where a mandate was in place until Tuesday, Aida Smith, 22, said that she had stopped masking on public transit after she was vaccinated against the coronavirus last year.“I feel like a lot of other people here did the same thing — got vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask,” she said.Darren Kettle, the chief executive of Metrolink, a commuter rail system that serves six large Southern California counties, said that officials spent most of the day on Monday figuring out what exactly the federal court ruling meant.But once he got word that the Transportation Security Administration would be lifting its mask requirement, he said, Metrolink decided to follow suit. “Not having this in place now gives people peace of mind that at least our conductors aren’t having to enforce something that was very difficult to enforce,” he said.— Jill Cowan,\\xa0Sophie Kasakove,\\xa0Tariro Mzezewa,\\xa0Robert Chiarito and Matt Berg Masks work best when everyone around you is wearing one. That’s because when a person infected with the coronavirus wears a mask, a large percentage of the infectious particles they exhale are trapped, stopping viral spread at the source. And when fewer viral particles are floating around the room, the masks others are wearing are likely to block those particles that have escaped.But there is also plenty of evidence showing that masks protect the wearer, even when others around them are mask-free.The amount of protection depends on the quality of the mask and how well it fits. Health experts recommend using an N95, KN95 or KF94 to protect yourself against the Omicron subvariant known as BA.2, which is now the dominant version of the coronavirus and is far more infectious than previous forms.Other variables, such as how much time you are exposed to an infected person and how well a space is ventilated, also will affect your risk.On most planes, for example, the cabin air is frequently pumped through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that are pretty good at reducing virus transmission. But that does not completely eliminate your risk.In a modeling study, published in December 2021, researchers found that passengers sitting in the same row or one row away from someone with the virus still had a high risk of getting infected through direct respiratory droplets. Wearing a mask reduced the risk of infection by 54 percent.In closed settings like a plane, it can be hard to avoid a mixed group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, symptomatic or asymptomatic people, all of whom may transmit the coronavirus at varying levels. And the flight may not even be the riskiest part of a trip.Air circulation may be running at low strength or completely turned off during boarding and deplaning, so those periods, as well as the time you spend at the airport, may be when you are at most risk of exposure and may benefit from wearing a mask.Other settings may be even more worrisome.“I know everyone talks about planes, but I would say buses are probably the riskiest, then trains and then planes, in order of highest to lowest,” said Linsey Marr, an expert in aerosol transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech.“People talk about planes having great ventilation filtration, and they do and that greatly helps reduce the risk of transmission,” she added. “But the virus is going to be in the air, no question in my mind, because there’s still large numbers of cases.”There is real-world data supporting the protective effects of masking in other indoor locations. In a 2020 investigation of a hotel outbreak in Switzerland, for instance, several employees and a guest who tested positive for the coronavirus were wearing only face shields (with no masks); those who wore masks were not infected.A number of laboratory studies, too, have documented that a mask protects the person who is wearing it, though the level of that protection can vary depending on the type of mask, the material it is made from, the experimental setup and how particle exposure was measured.While the lab studies all show a mask can protect the wearer, how well the masks perform in the real world depends on a number of variables, including how consistently people use them, whether a person is in high-risk situations and the rate of infection in the community.The laboratory studies showed that a high-quality medical mask, like an N95, KN95 or KF94, works best. While vaccination and a booster shot or two provide the best protection against infection with the coronavirus, even vaccinated people should be cautious around crowds or large groups indoors when the vaccination status of others is not known.Dr. Marr recommends wearing the highest-quality mask possible when you can’t keep your distance or be outdoors — or when nobody around you is masking up. That means an N95 or its equivalent.Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.— Tara Parker-Pope and Knvul Sheikh After a federal judge struck down the United States mask mandate for planes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, several European airlines made mask-wearing optional for passengers on their trans-Atlantic flights.The rules in Europe were already shifting, and a number of European countries were well ahead of the United States in easing coronavirus travel restrictions, including mask mandates and pre-departure testing for air travel. Many European airlines have been requiring passengers and crew members to wear face coverings only on flights to countries that require them.Britain dropped all its remaining coronavirus travel restrictions last month, and British Airways and Virgin Atlantic were among the first carriers to make mask-wearing optional, unless the destination required masks. Both airlines updated their mask policies on Tuesday to make masks optional on flights to U.S. destinations.“We encourage everyone to be respectful of fellow passengers’ mask preferences, and across our network, we continue to adhere to all regulatory requirements, recognizing that mask requirements differ by market,” Virgin Atlantic said in a statement on Tuesday.Other European airlines, like Air France and Lufthansa, said they would continue to enforce mask mandates on all their routes, in line with French and German coronavirus regulations. The Dutch airline KLM stopped enforcing mask mandates last month, but said it “strongly recommends” that passengers wear them, in line with guidance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.— Ceylan Yeginsu For many flight attendants, the striking down of the mask mandate for planes brought relief on Tuesday.Flight crews have faced a surge in threats and violence from passengers during the pandemic. In many cases, the rage is sparked by resistance to complying with the mask mandate, which is enforced by the crews on planes.“I’ve got nothing but extremely positive feedback,” said John Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents thousands of flight attendants and other airline, railroad and transit workers. “There was and remains a tension in the air.”David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue Airways who is now chief executive of Breeze Airways, said that he and many of his crew members welcomed the news. “They don’t like being policemen on airplanes,” he said. “It’s not something that they signed up for, and I think it creates more agitation with customers.”Unions representing flight attendants and pilots have long called for stronger action to address the increase in violence, with many welcoming a proposed bill in Congress that would impose tougher penalties for those convicted of assaulting flight crews and place those individuals on a no-fly list.For flight attendants who choose to do so, being able to work without masks may also help them to regain an important tool for de-escalating conflicts, too.“Even just a smile, even just to say ‘good morning,’ ‘good afternoon,’ ‘welcome aboard,’ hopefully that will help to decrease tension on board as well,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of TWU Local 556, which represents about 17,000 Southwest Airlines flight attendants. “It seems like a little thing, but it’s actually something we use quite a lot.”The new policy also created issues.“Yesterday’s mid-flight announcements on the lifting of mask mandates created confusion and uncertainty in our cabins,” Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, said in a statement.At Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning, most agents with the Transportation Security Administration kept their faces covered, at least at the Terminal 3 security checkpoint.A masked agent, who was checking luggage, stood next to a bare-faced colleague. Around the airport, blue signs reminded travelers, “Masks required! All travelers and employees must wear a face covering over their nose and mouth while in the airport.” Of three gate agents at D1, only one kept his face covered. Two pilots strode maskless through the terminal and onto a plane.Pilots seemed to be in a buoyant mood on Monday evening. In a widely shared video, passengers on a flight from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska, were heard applauding after a pilot congratulated them for being able to remove their masks.Jonathan Russell Biehl, a pilot for Delta Air Lines, was midway between Tampa and Minneapolis when he got a message about the dropping of the mask rule. “I would say this is the day I’ve been waiting for a long time,” Mr. Biehl, 46, said on Tuesday. “It’s really exciting not to have to be forced to wear a mask against my will.”It was not immediately clear what effect the removal of mask requirements would have on travel demand. Airlines are enjoying a robust rebound. Last week, Delta reported that March was its best sales month ever.— Niraj Chokshi,\\xa0Heather Murphy and Kristin Hussey The announcement by major U.S. airlines on Monday that they would drop mask mandates after a federal judge struck down the nationwide requirement has raised fresh questions about Covid safety on flights.On most single-aisle planes, you are constantly breathing a mixture of fresh and recirculated air. The air in the cabin is filtered and refreshed roughly every two to three minutes — a higher rate than in grocery stores and other indoor spaces, experts say. It’s one reason, in addition to safety protocols, that there have not been many superspreader events documented on flights since the beginning of the pandemic.But that doesn’t mean flights are completely safe.In early 2021, with the help of researchers, The New York Times simulated more than 2 million air particles to understand how they flow within the cabin, and how potential viral elements may pose a risk.As air blows from the sides of the plane, particles move toward the aisle, where they combine with air from the opposite row. To prevent air from circulating throughout the cabin, the ventilation system keeps it contained to a few rows.Not all particles are the same size, and most don’t contain infectious viral matter. But if someone were to sneeze, for example, even if that person were wearing a mask, the chances of passengers nearby inhaling viral particles greatly increase.See how the ventilation system works:— Mika Gröndahl As vaccines become widely available and restrictions are eased, millions of people are flying again, raising questions about just how safe it is now to board a flight.Moderna announced preliminary results Tuesday from its study of a coronavirus vaccine intended to protect against variants, saying the findings show it can design a vaccine that offers better, longer-lasting protection than its initial product.But the company said it was also testing another version of the vaccine that it expected would do even better, with results expected in late May or early June.The company’s findings, published in a paper without being evaluated by outside scientists, offer hope that the nation will have a better vaccine by the fall, when the coronavirus is considered likely to re-emerge in force.Researchers at Moderna, other pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health have been racing to figure out how to redesign the existing vaccines in time for new booster doses to be manufactured over the summer. Moderna’s results are the first of their kind to be released.The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech continue to strongly protect most people from hospitalization and death caused by Covid-19. But their potency against infection wanes quickly. Federal officials recently authorized additional shots for people 50 and older, citing concerns about waning protection against severe disease in vulnerable populations.Moderna said its research showed the promise of a so-called bivalent vaccine, even against other variants besides the two versions of the virus specifically targeted. In this case, researchers combined the existing vaccine with one designed to attack the Beta variant, which was first detected in late 2020. They found the combination provided a stronger defense not only against those forms of the virus, but also against the Delta and Omicron variants, the company said.Volunteers who got a booster shot of the reconfigured vaccine produced more than two times the level of antibodies against the Omicron variant compared with those who got a booster dose of the existing Moderna vaccine. The added protection persisted for six months against the Omicron variant but fell against Delta to essentially the same level as that elicited by the existing vaccine, the study showed.Moderna said although Beta was an early variant, it was relevant to test because it contains several mutations that “have been persistent in more recent variants of concern, including Omicron.”— Sharon LaFraniere After two years of warning travelers to avoid visiting a very long list of countries deemed to be “high risk” for coronavirus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped them all from its list.The change happened on Monday because the C.D.C. revised its international Covid-19 travel advisory system, and now reserves its most serious warning category, Level 4, for extreme situations like “rapidly escalating case trajectory or extremely high case counts, emergence of a new variant of concern, and health care infrastructure collapse,” the C.D.C. said in an update. Previously, the agency determined which countries warranted Level 4 warnings based on counts of new coronavirus cases.The U.S. Travel Association and airline executives have asked the C.D.C. and the Biden administration to ease restrictions and mask mandates for international travel in order to help airlines bounce back from a steep loss of business during the pandemic. A judge struck down the federal mask mandate for public transportation on Monday, prompting many airlines to immediately drop their mask requirements.Before the C.D.C. revised its advisory system on Monday, more than 90 countries were in the Level 4 category, including Costa Rica, France and Iceland.Levels 1, 2 and 3 in the system continue to be determined primarily by new-case counts over the most recent 28 days. Countries and territories with a “high level of Covid-19” — \\xa0currently, 122 of them — are put in Level 3 and those with a “moderate level of Covid-19” are put in Level 2 — currently a dozen. (The United States also qualifies for Level 3.)Travelers who are not fully vaccinated are advised to avoid traveling to Level 2 or Level 3 countries entirely, and people with weak immune systems are advised to speak to their doctors about how to stay safe when traveling there.Countries with a “low level of Covid-19” — currently 55 of them — are put in Level 1, and the C.D.C. recommends that travelers be up-to-date with vaccines before visiting them.Some 48 countries and territories are not assigned any level in the travel advisory system because not enough data was available. The C.D.C. warns travelers who are not fully vaccinated to avoid such places; many are small and remote, but some are tourist destinations.Although there are no longer any blanket “do not travel” warnings related to the coronavirus, travelers should still be aware that many countries have pandemic-related entry requirements. And the C.D.C. has issued warnings over issues unrelated to the coronavirus, like the lack of medical infrastructure in Venezuela and polio in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.The State Department said last week that it would adjust its own travel advisories and would no longer automatically correlate its guidance with the C.D.C.’s. Even so, if the C.D.C. assigns a country to Level 4 because of pandemic risk, the State Department’s travel advisory for that destination will also rise to Level 4.— Isabella Grullón Paz On Monday, a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation. The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do. By late Monday, the nation’s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights, and the Amtrak rail system had lifted its mandate.For many, the announcement was welcomed. Travelers who were already on their way when the announcement came cheered and de-masked midflight. Some employees said they had been frustrated by having to police passengers. But for others, the announcement has been met with alarm and concern about the spread of the coronavirus.Our reporters want to know how you feel about the announcement and whether it will change your masking behavior.Tell us your perspective below. We won’t use your name or identifying information without your permission, and we may contact you to hear more.— The New York Times Airbnb announced today that the lodging company would no longer issue refunds for Covid-19 related cancellations starting May 31, 2022.“As a result of this new way of living, beginning 31 May, we are updating our Extenuating Circumstances policy to no longer cover Covid-19 related circumstances as a reason for a refund for bookings made on or after this date,” the company said in a press release. This updated policy doesn’t apply to reservations made in South Korea and China. Airbnb quickly pivoted to say that other companies in the travel industry also rolled back similar policies earlier this year, or didn’t provide one at all. While Airbnb did not specify which of their competitors they were referring to, Vrbo, a similar service, has also recently updated its guidelines related to Covid-19 related cancelations, saying a property’s cancelation policy may apply even if a reservation is impacted by Covid-19.Airbnb did say that two-thirds of the listings on their site offered guests the chance to cancel a reservation no less than 5 days before check-in for a full refund. Some listings even offer full refunds for cancellation up to 24-hours before check-in. So, there’s still a chance you could get your money back if something comes up. The news comes after yesterday’s companywide announcement that Airbnb would be moving to a hybrid work schedule, which would allow employees to live and work wherever they want, de-centralizing the office from the company’s culture. While this shift to a permanent hybrid work configuration doesn’t seem to be directly due to the current state of Covid-19 (which Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed is no longer a pandemic in the U.S.), it is clearly fueled by the shift to remote work that began in March 2020.“Two years ago, the world was turned upside down. Our offices closed and we found ourselves working from our bedrooms, basements, and home offices,” CEO Brian Chesky wrote to Airbnb employees in an email. He continued: The right solution should combine the best of the digital world and the best of the physical world. It should have the efficiency of Zoom, while providing the meaningful human connection that only happens when people come together. We have a solution that we think combines the best of both worlds.Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro, such as spatial audio and water resistance.While the pandemic normalized the ability to work remotely, it also kinda gave people a ‘get out of jail free’ card when it came to canceling plans—including vacation reservations. While Covid-19 will soon no longer be a valid reason to get a refund from an Airbnb cancelation, the impact of the pandemic will still be around when it comes to the ability for their employees to work remotely. AdvertisementBy Julian E. BarnesWilliam J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, a day after meeting with President Biden.The meeting was not considered a close contact for Mr. Biden because the two practiced social distancing and Mr. Burns was wearing an N95 mask, according to a C.I.A. statement. Mr. Biden tested negative on Wednesday when he was screened as part of regular health monitoring, an administration official said.Mr. Burns, who is 65, fully vaccinated and boosted, is experiencing mild symptoms, the C.I.A. statement said, adding that he is now isolating and will work from his home. He will return to the agency’s headquarters in Virginia after isolating for five days and then testing negative for the virus.The positive test will prevent Mr. Burns from briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill or attending White House briefings while he remains in isolation. Though Mr. Burns attends intelligence briefings at the White House several times a month, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, has primary responsibility for Mr. Biden’s regular intelligence sessions.Mr. Burns will continue to perform his duties from home rather than handing responsibility to David S. Cohen, the deputy director. In the statement, Mr. Burns said he remains fully engaged despite the mild symptoms.As director of the C.I.A., Mr. Burns’s work is almost exclusively with classified material. Common practice would be for senior national security officials to use secure devices when working and communicating from home or anywhere else outside their offices.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byWhile Kamala Harris had not seen President Biden for eight days, her positive test renewed concerns about his vulnerability to the virus.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Peter Baker and Aishvarya KaviWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday, becoming the latest high-ranking official in Washington to be infected amid renewed concern about President Biden’s potential exposure as the virus ripples through his administration.Ms. Harris received her test results shortly after returning to the White House following several days in California, then left the West Wing without seeing Mr. Biden to isolate at the vice president’s residence. While she typically sees the president most weekdays they are both in town, aides said she had not been with him in person in eight days.Two Democratic senators, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, also tested positive on Tuesday, depriving Democrats of a working majority to push through legislation or nominations for the next few days. In an evenly split Senate, Democrats need every member plus the vice president’s tiebreaking vote to overcome uniform Republican opposition.Senate Democrats had hoped to approve multiple nominations this week, including Lisa D. Cook to be a governor of the Federal Reserve and Alvaro Bedoya to be a member of the Federal Trade Commission. Given that neither received any Republican support during earlier procedural votes, the latest Covid absences scrambled the equation for Democrats.While Ms. Harris by happenstance has not been near Mr. Biden in recent days, her infection served as a reminder of the dangers for Mr. Biden, who at 79 is the oldest person ever sworn into the presidency and in an age group considered more vulnerable to the virus. He has been traveling and appearing in public more lately, including three trips out of town last week, which increases his potential exposure, and aides on Tuesday sounded resigned to the prospect that he may be infected eventually.“It is possible he could test positive for Covid, just like any American,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. “Even though he’s double-boosted, that is possible. And we will be very transparent if that were to take place.”She said the president and his staff make a risk assessment for his travels outside the White House and he has proceeded lately with trips that he considers “vitally important to him, to his presidency, to the American people.”Mr. Biden plans to deliver a eulogy for former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright at a memorial service on Wednesday at Washington National Cathedral, where he will be among an estimated 1,400 mourners, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr. Biden is also scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association annual dinner on Saturday night, along with about 2,600 officials, journalists and others in a basement hotel ballroom.The most recent of these big Washington grip-and-grin dinners led to an extensive outbreak that swept through much of the capital’s elite. At least 80 guests at the Gridiron Dinner last month tested positive afterward, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three members of Mr. Biden’s cabinet: Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.Ms. Harris was not at the dinner, but her communications director, Jamal Simmons, attended and tested positive afterward. The infections of both the vice president and House speaker mean that the first and second in line of succession to the presidency have now been hit by the virus in short order.Ms. Harris, 57, received her second booster shot on April 1, three days after federal regulators authorized a second dose of the vaccine for people over age 50. It takes about a week for a shot to boost the immune system. Mr. Biden has also received a second booster shot. The last time the two were together was on April 18, according to a White House official.Ms. Harris, who returned from a trip to San Francisco and Los Angeles on Monday, went to her office at the White House on Tuesday morning and took a rapid antigen test as part of the regular protocol for the president and vice president. When it came back positive, she took a P.C.R. test, which also came back positive. At that point, rather than attend the daily intelligence briefing with the president as scheduled, she returned home, where aides said she would remain until she tests negative. Mr. Biden later called to check in on her, aides said.After consulting her doctors, Ms. Harris also started a course of Paxlovid, her press secretary said in a tweet. The antiviral pill made by Pfizer is intended for high-risk patients, and it was not immediately clear whether she qualified.Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris’s husband, tested positive for the virus in mid-March. At the time, Ms. Harris was forced to back out of an event with the president, although she continued to test negative. Mr. Emhoff told McClatchy News last week that he had isolated from his wife for 10 days while infected, staying in an upstairs room and having food brought up to him.The spate of infections in the upper reaches of Washington came amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA.2, and served as a reminder that the pandemic endures even as officials seek to roll back restrictions.Officials in the White House said they were contact tracing to determine who may have been near Ms. Harris in recent days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a close contact as someone who spends at least 15 minutes within six feet of the infected person over a 24-hour period. Officials have repeatedly emphasized that the White House maintains stricter measures than the C.D.C. advises.AdvertisementBy Robin BrantBBC Shanghai correspondentThis video can not be playedDozens of elderly patients at a hospital in Shanghai have died after contracting Covid-19, but official government figures claim no deaths in the city have been caused by the disease since 2020.The BBC has spoken to a hospital manager and had access to correspondence sent to relatives of patients who\\'ve died during the Omicron outbreak that is sweeping through China\\'s biggest city.We\\'ve also had access to official documents that suggest at least 27 patients from a single hospital, who weren\\'t vaccinated, have died from what it called \"underlying health problems\".Shanghai is enforcing a mammoth lockdown as authorities try to contain a new wave of the virus. Most of the city\\'s almost 25 million population have been ordered to stay inside for three weeks.The BBC has previously reported evidence that authorities in Shanghai are struggling to deal with the outbreak. We spoke to a nurse and a health worker at Donghai Elderly Care Hospital who, between them, described desperate attempts to help dozens of elderly patients, some of whom have died.We\\'ve contacted several other care homes or hospitals for the elderly since then, after social media postings suggested there was evidence of widespread infections among hundreds of patients in 12 other facilities here.One relative of a patient at another care home in Shanghai has told us that doctors and caregivers working there had informed her that everyone in the facility had tested positive. It has capacity for around 300 patients.In a phone conversation a manager at Donghai Hospital told us: \"Of course there would be deceased with Covid. [In  Shanghai the situation is like this. How could there not be any death[s  without Covid?\"In a letter sent to relatives of patients who\\'d died management at the hospital apologised and admitted a \"lack of professionalism\". They also expressed their \"deepest guilt\".Official figures say there have been no deaths during the current outbreak across the city; none at all. China has a strict criteria for confirming Covid-19 cases, which includes evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus. This must be confirmed in a scan.Any underlying health conditions is also considered before deaths are officially attributed to Covid.One man whose 72-year-old sister died at Donghai earlier this month told us that he had struggled to get a full explanation from officials about the cause of death. He told us that she had tested negative in the weeks before she died on 3 April. But he was not able to get a record of her test results in the final days before she died.The man said his sister was one of six patients in a room, five of whom died. He told the BBC that \"the outbreak [was  so bad in that care home\". As far as he could tell the official record said \"she died with Covid negative\". He said he would not go ahead with her cremation until he knew what the cause of death was.Relatives of a 99-year-old woman who died on 1 April have also raised concerns about the cause of death, given that she tested positive in the final week of her life.In social media postings seen by the BBC, with accompanying audio records, her granddaughter said the woman had been transferred to Jinshan Public Health Clinical Centre in Shanghai on 27 March, where she tested positive a day later.She was treated for underlying health problems. Three days later she tested negative for Covid. A day later she died. The woman described her death as due to \"aggravation of underlying disease due to Covid\". The BBC tried multiple times to contact authorities at Donghai and Jinshan regarding the various allegations, but was not able to get a response.China is facing its most serious crisis since the virus first emerged here in early 2020, when the city of Wuhan was locked down and sealed off.Despite efforts to limit the impact on the economy in the country\\'s financial capital the lockdown of Shanghai has continued way beyond the initial nine day period planned for. Authorities have used various terms to refer to the strict restrictions being imposed on people, calling it \"static management\" and \"closed management\".State media reported that President Xi Jinping said \"prevention and control work cannot be relaxed\".

doing so  it is following the lead of countries like Denmark  Switzerland  and the Dominican Republic  which have removed legal requirements to self isolate after a positive test In these countries  there is no longer a support net that enables people to avoid financial penalties if they fall ill  Until now in England  employees have been able to claim statutory sick pay  SSP  from the first day of illness  which amounts to               a week  In a similar approach  countries like Estonia  Latvia  Portugal  Sweden  and France waived waiting periods for sick pay and sickness benefits to fight the spread of the virus With Covid    infection levels in some areas of the UK at their highest since the pandemic began  the government s decision to drop restrictions is problematic  UK prime minister Boris Johnson s advice to cope with these changes was to  be more disciplined about not going into work when you are sick   He encouraged Britons to break a lifelong habit of presenteeism and be more like German workers  Except Germans receive     percent of their pay for eight weeks if they fall ill  representing one of the highest sick pay rates in Europe  Britons get the lowest  In the US  where the government is under pressure to drop Covid    restrictions and mask mandates  there is no statutory sick pay at all Staying home when sick has never been part of the UK s cultural fabric  where employees face pressure to not  let down the side   Going into work when sick is the norm in the country  even when the illness could easily be passed on to others  Data from      found that    percent of Britons would go into work with an infectious illness  The same research found that almost a quarter feel their manager would prefer it if they attended work in those circumstances  And so the contagion can spread When the pandemic was in its early stages  there was some hope that it would end  or at least reduce  presenteeism in the workplace  However  in a country where statutory sick pay is getting worse  this is nothing but a pipe dream  In an era of remote work  the need to soldier on has prevailed  In the first year of the pandemic  Britons actually took fewer sick days than in       reaching the lowest rate since       Over half of hybrid workers     percent  and nearly half of remote workers     percent  said they feel obligated to work while unwell when they re working remotely The correlation between paid sick leave and sick days taken is hard to ignore  Workers offered the most generous sick pay take the most absences  and those offered the least  take the least  Employees in Norway  Luxembourg  Germany  Austria  and Belgium  who receive     percent of their wages from their first week of illness and for a month minimum  also take some of the most sick days in Europe  On average  Germans take      days off sick every year  while Britons take just      Incentivizing staying home from day one is particularly important in the context of Covid  as viral load and risk of infection peak quickly once symptoms begin and people can remain contagious for up to    days Alex Collinson  an analysis and research officer at the UK s Trades Union Congress  TUC   points out that the reintroduction of the three day waiting period means that if someone isolates for five days of a week  they only get paid for two days   It brings SSP down from     a week to      which is not enough to live off   he says   It s a massive barrier to doing the right thing  The TUC is proposing an increase to around      per week  as suggested by the Living Wage Foundation   When people get sick  they should not be faced with financial hardship for taking time off   says Collinson  The new rules are particularly galling for those who are clinically vulnerable and may struggle to return to the workplace  Alison Crockford works in cybersecurity as an awareness manager and is immunosuppressed due to a kidney transplant   I would love to go back to the office on a hybrid model  but now that testing and isolation is no longer the norm  it s far more difficult for me to travel to the office and work safely   she explains  The perception that those with underlying conditions  were going to die anyway  and couldn t be happy  functioning members of society depresses me   says the    year old   The  othering  of anyone who s not fortunate enough to be completely healthy right now is exhausting  Beyond  getting better at not going to work while sick   no part of England s plan gives a credible explanation on how the immunocompromised and people with disabilities are meant to live and do their jobs alongside the virus  We ve worked well in the UK for some time to advance ability status equality in the workplace  but the lifting of these measures takes a step back   explains Simon Williams  a behavioral scientist at Swansea University  Indeed  data gathered by the UK s Office for National Statistics  ONS  in mid March shows that people with disabilities were more likely to think life would never return to normal  and    percent are avoiding close contact with those they don t live with  compared to    percent of nondisabled  The majority are spending more time at home too Throughout the pandemic  close attention has been paid to the number of Britons who ve lost their lives to Covid  but less has been paid to those who have lost their health to long Covid  The true impact of this debilitating condition is beginning to come to light  According to self reported stats from the ONS      million Britons are experiencing symptoms lasting longer than four weeks since they were infected  including fatigue  shortness of breath  and difficulty breathing  Some    percent report that their ability to undertake day to day activities has been limited  a lot  Needless to say  the impact on businesses has and will be monumental  A quarter of British employers cite long Covid as the main cause for long term health related absence  in a survey of     organizations with over     million employees by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development  Some    percent have employees with long Covid  The Resolution Foundation think tank suggests there s a high chance that it s a contributing factor in the UK s labor shortage and the  Great Resignation   The same is true in the US  according to the Brookings Institution The TUC is calling for the government to recognize long Covid as a disability   It would protect workers under the Equality Act and  most importantly  give them the right to reasonable adjustments at work   says Collinson   That includes everything from flexible working arrangements to longer rest breaks and special software and equipment  An innate work ethic  pressure from the top  and financial worries are all contributing factors  but as employees return to offices  Williams says  this overarching presenteeism is terrible for public health   It contributes to avoidable transmission of infectious illnesses not just Covid which isn t cost effective for businesses   he says   A lot of countries have much better sick pay  and raising it would help to change a culturally ingrained habit of feeling unwell  complaining about it  but doing it anyway  With absenteeism now a luxury many workers can t afford  the pressure is on individual businesses to foster environments that recognize all levels of vulnerability   We do have to live with Covid and focus on personal responsibility   says Williams   But there s a danger that if we say personal responsibility or policy  we throw the baby out with the bathwater  The best approach is a set of policies that entrust people with the ability to exercise responsibility and be cautious  At the very least  if governments want people to self isolate and they should they need to get paid enough to live on  Perhaps then  they could be more like the Germans More From WIREDContact       Cond  Nast  All rights reserved  Use of this site constitutes

Anyone can read what you share By David LeonhardtThe short term and long term flaws with the country s current Covid    policy are quite different In the short term  the main problem is a lack of demand for Covid vaccines and treatments  Not enough people are trying to get them  In the longer term   by the second half of this year   the bigger problem may end up being a lack of supply  especially if cases surge again I think this distinction has gotten lost in some of the public discussion  Yesterday  President Biden called for additional Covid funding  after Congress had left out such money from its most recent spending bill because of a disagreement over how to pay for it  We need to secure additional supply now   Biden said in a brief speech  shortly before receiving his second booster shot onstage   We can t wait until we find ourselves in the midst of another surge to act  It ll be too late  Biden is right that the lack of funding creates problems  To ensure an adequate supply of vaccines and treatments later this year  the government probably needs to take action soon  Democrats and Republicans have been negotiating over a possible deal this week But the potential funding shortfall is nowhere near the entire problem  A lack of money is not preventing many Americans from getting vaccinated or getting valuable treatments right now  Even if Congress does pass more Covid funding  the country will still face a problem that is more about information and persuasion than dollars For months  the United States has been awash in Covid vaccine shots  and many Americans would benefit from getting one  About one quarter of adults remain unvaccinated  while roughly another quarter are vaccinated but not boosted  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  A booster shot sharply reduces the chances of severe Covid illness  especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and immunocompromised I know that last point may sound counterintuitive  The elderly and immunocompromised  even if boosted  face a higher risk of severe illness than a healthy  younger person  But a booster shot still reduces the risk more for a vulnerable person than for an average person  It s a common dynamic in medicine  Treatments tend to be most valuable for the most vulnerable even if they do not eliminate risk Despite the huge value of additional vaccine shots  many Americans simply aren t getting one  The number of shots given per day  including both initial doses and boosters  has fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign  in early      Including first  second and booster doses  million doses        average doseson March   Jan      Feb March  million doses        average doseson March   Jan      Feb March  million doses        average doseson March   Jan      Feb MarchSource  Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBy The New York TimesWhat might help Employer and customer mandates would probably nudge more people to get initial shots  Previous employer mandates have generally caused more people to get vaccinated and only a tiny share to quit or be fired  But mandates have fallen out of fashion  Even some politically liberal places  like New York City and Washington  D C   have been dropping theirs recently Boosting more people seems as if it should be more feasible  because it involves people who have already received a shot  Still  boosters are lagging  Many Americans seem confused about how much a booster shot matters The scientific evidence suggests that everybody who is eligible should get a first booster shot  A second booster shot   now available to people    and older  among others   may also make sense  although the benefits appear smaller  And if you are boosted and have already had Omicron  you probably don t need another booster yet  Dr  Eric Topol of Scripps Research notes  as part of his helpful overview of the evidence  The story is similar with both Evusheld  a drug that appears to boost immunity among the immunocompromised  and post infection treatments that reduce the chance of severe illness  They are widely available  yet many people remain unaware of them Many doctors also seem uncertain how and when to prescribe them   Doctors are beginning to use this   a Biden administration official told me   but it takes a while for things to get absorbed in medical practice  Biden yesterday announced a new federal website   Covid gov   where people can search for pharmacies near them that have both Evusheld and the treatments  I found most parts of it simple to use  But I also thought that Rob Relyea  a Microsoft engineer who has become an advocate for the immunocompromised  made a good critique on Twitter  The Evusheld information is too hard to find The bottom line is that Americans would benefit from hearing a series of clear  repeated messages Getting a booster shot may save your life Many immunocompromised people would probably be helped by Evusheld  and it s available Vulnerable people   like the elderly   should talk with a doctor as soon as they test positive for Covid and seek treatments that can reduce its severity  like Paxlovid or molnupiravir As Biden said yesterday   America has the tools to protect people  If more people become aware of the treatments  however  some of them are likely to run low later this year  And if the federal government waits until then to act  it may discover that other countries have bought the available supply   You can t snap your fingers and buy the stuff   the Biden administration official told me Already  the administration has reduced shipments of one kind of treatment   monoclonal antibodies   that it is sending to states  It has also said it would cut back on new orders of Evusheld in the next several days A Covid bill would likely cost     billion to     billion  or less than      percent of the annual federal budget  Congressional Republicans have said that the money should be diverted from another area  rather than add to the deficit  My colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg  who covers the pandemic from Washington  said Congress was likely to agree on a funding source soon

ApplicationRoboticsSectorHealth careTechnologyRoboticsSince February  the nurses at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg  Virginia  have had an extra assistant on their shifts  Moxi  a   foot tall robot that ferries medication  supplies  lab samples  and personal items through the halls  from floor to floor  After two years of battling Covid    and related burnout  nurses say it s been a welcome relief  There s two levels of burnout  There s  we re short this weekend  burnout  and then there s pandemic burnout  which our care teams are experiencing right now   says Abigail Hamilton  a former ICU and emergency room nurse that manages nursing staff support programs at the hospital Moxi is one of several specialized delivery robots that has been developed in recent years to ease the strain on health care workers  Even before the pandemic  nearly half of US nurses felt that their workplace lacked adequate work life balance  The emotional toll of seeing patients die and colleagues infected at such a large scale and fear of bringing Covid    home to family has made feelings of burnout worse  Studies also found that burnout can have long term consequences for nurses  including cognitive impacts and insomnia years after the exhaustion of their early careers  The world already had a nurse shortage going into the pandemic  now  roughly two out of three nurses in the US say they have considered leaving the profession  according to a survey from the National Nurses United union In some places the shortage is leading to higher wages for permanent staff and for temporary travel nurses  In countries such as Finland  nurses are demanding better pay and going on strike  But it s also paved the way for more robots in health care settings At the forefront of this trend is Moxi  which has spent the pandemic rolling down the halls of some of the largest hospitals in the country  carrying objects like a smartphone or beloved teddy bear to patients in emergency rooms when Covid    protocol kept family members from bedsides Moxi was created by Diligent Robotics  a company cofounded in      by Vivian Chu  a former Google X researcher  and Andrea Thomaz  who developed Moxi while working as an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin  The roboticists met when Thomaz advised Chu at Georgia Tech s Socially Intelligent Machines Lab  The first Moxi commercial deployment came months after the start of the pandemic  About    Moxi robots are now operational in US hospitals  with an additional    scheduled to deploy later this year  In       any hospital that was thinking about working with us  it was a special project for the CFO or innovation project about the hospital of the future   says Diligent Robotics CEO Andrea Thomaz   What we saw over the last two years is that almost every single health care system is thinking about robotics and automation or has robotics and automation on their strategic agenda  A range of robots have been developed in recent years to carry out health care tasks like disinfecting hospital wards or assisting physical therapists  Robots that touch people like Robear  which helped lift elderly people out of bed in Japan remain largely experimental  due in part to liability and regulatory requirements  Far more common are specialized delivery robots Moxi is equipped with a robotic arm and can greet passersby with cooing sounds and heart eyes on a digital face  But in practice Moxi is less of a caregiver and more like Tug  another hospital delivery robot  or Burro  a robot helping farm workers in California grape vineyards  A camera on the front and lidar sensor on the back help Moxi map the floors of hospitals and spot people and items it should avoid Nurses can hail Moxi robots from kiosks at nursing stations or send the robot a task via text message  Moxi might be used to transport items that are too big to fit into a tube system  like IV pumps  lab samples and other fragile cargo  or specialty items  like a slice of birthday cake A survey of nurses who worked with delivery robots similar to Moxi in a hospital in Cyprus found that roughly half expressed concern that robots represent a threat to their jobs  but they have a long way to go before they could conceivably replace humans  Moxi still needs help with basic tasks  For example  Moxi might have to ask a human to press an elevator button for a specific floor More concerning  the cybersecurity risks hospital delivery robots present aren t very well understood  Last week  security firm Cynerio showed that exploiting a vulnerability can allow hackers to take remote control of Tug robots or open patients up to privacy violations   No comparable bugs have been found in Moxi robots  and the company says it s taking steps to ensure its  security position   Around the time of Moxi s first commercial deployment in       an American Nurses Association supported case study assessed Moxi trials at hospitals in Dallas  Houston  and Galveston  Texas  Researchers cautioned that use of such robots requires more thorough supply management by hospital staff  because robots don t read expiration dates  using expired bandages can increase risk of infections A majority of the    nurses interviewed as part of the review said Moxi gave them more time to talk with patients being discharged from the hospital  Numerous nurses said Moxi saved them energy  brought joy to patients and their families  and ensured that patients always had water when it was time for them to take their medication   I could do it faster  but it s better for Moxi to do it so I can do something else more useful   said one of the surveyed nurses  In less positive feedback  nurses complained that Moxi had trouble maneuvering through cramped halls during the morning rush or anticipating needs by accessing electronic health records  Another said some patients were suspicious of  the robot s eyes recording them   Authors of that case study concluded that Moxi is incapable of delivering skilled nursing care and is best suited to focusing on low risk  repetitive tasks that can save nurses time Those types of tasks can represent big business  In addition to its recent expansion into new hospitals  Diligent Robotics announced the closure of a     million funding round last week  The company will use the funding in part to more closely integrate Moxi s software with electronic health records in order to carry out tasks without the need for a nurse or doctor to make a request In her experience  Abigail Hamilton

American biochemist had been working to realize the therapeutic potential of mRNA first trying to create a synthetic version of the messenger molecule that wouldn t trigger the body s inflammatory response  and then  once she and colleague Drew Weissman had achieved that goal  trying to get the medical and scientific community to pay attention She had envisioned the technology being used to treat those recovering from heart attacks and strokes  But it was the frantic race for a Covid vaccine that earned Karik  belated global recognition  The work she and her colleagues had done on mRNA provided the foundation for Moderna and BioNTech to quickly develop Covid vaccines that have now saved millions of lives Traditional vaccines train the immune system by introducing it to harmless versions of whole viruses the body learns to recognize the virus s key features  such as SARS CoV   s infamous spike protein  These new mRNA vaccines found a more elegant way to achieve the same goal  using messenger RNA a genetic molecule found throughout nature that s used to transmit information within and between cells to provide the body with a set of instructions on how to make the spike protein itself  essentially borrowing the body s internal machinery and turning it into a photocopier This difference allowed mRNA vaccines to be designed  created  and approved in record time  Over the past    months  mRNA technology has been injected into billions of arms and has helped slow the devastating impact of the pandemic  But its long term impact accelerated by Covid could be even greater   It seems like the sky is the limit   says Karik    Previously the belief was not there  Dozens of clinical trials are now underway for new forms of the mRNA vaccine targeting everything from malaria to Zika  herpes  and cytomegalovirus  Last month  Moderna which was founded in      to explore the potential of mRNA announced it had started Phase I clinical trials for two mRNA based HIV vaccines   The timeline for what can be achieved using the mRNA platform is so much better   says Carl Dieffenbach  director of the Division of AIDS at the US National Institutes of Health  who is overseeing those trials There was some work on mRNA happening before the pandemic Moderna had spent years on the lipid envelope that encases the strand of mRNA in the vaccine  for instance   Like all overnight successes  mRNA has been in development for a long time   says Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  CEPI   The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority invested in an mRNA vaccine for Zika in       but  the urgency sort of trailed off  as the outbreak subsided  Hatchett says  There had also been tentative attempts to develop mRNA platforms for other coronaviruses  such as MERS  work that proved crucial when Covid broke out  Moderna was able to tweak its MERS vaccine for the new disease  meaning its Covid vaccine entered clinical trials just    days after SARS CoV   s genetic sequence was published It s true that mRNA vaccines would probably have come to market eventually  but they were on what Dieffenbach calls  a leisurely stroll   Covid  pressure tested  them advancing their emergence by years or decades  Karik  remembers organizing the first mRNA conference in      and says that nobody in attendance would have expected an FDA approved product less than    years later   Because of the success against Covid  we re going to see tremendous investment  and we re going to learn just how flexible it is and how finely we can target   says Hatchett One of mRNA s strengths is its  remarkable agility   as Hatchett puts it  Its only raw ingredients are the four nucleotides that form the  letters  of the RNA sequence  so it can be designed and made pretty rapidly   Biological manufacturing is very hard and temperamental and has been difficult to introduce in many environments  It s taken India decades to build up the vaccine manufacturing capability they have   says Hatchett   It may be easier for countries to develop an mRNA production capacity than traditional biological manufacturing capability  Developing countries could  Hatchett suggests  leapfrog over traditional vaccine manufacturing processes and go straight to mRNA mRNA plants are already being planned in countries across Africa and Asia  After Covid  they could be quickly repurposed to create vaccines for other diseases all you need to do is change the order of the bases in the mRNA to give the body a new set of instructions  There are also far fewer concerns about purity or contamination than with traditional vaccines the body quickly translates  expresses  and breaks down the strand of mRNA  mRNA is completely interchangeable   says Jackie Miller  senior vice president for infectious diseases at Moderna   What changes between the different vaccines is the DNA template that we utilize to synthesize the messenger RNA  but across all of our vaccine portfolio  we re using the same lipid nanoparticle  CEPI wants to use that flexibility to create a library of mRNA vaccines against each of the viral families known to cause human disease  This would cost     billion to     billion  Hatchett estimates  but it would enable a rapid response to any new outbreaks   The lesson from      is that     days  the time from sequencing the genome of SARS CoV   to administering the first doses of a Covid vaccine outside of trials  is terrific  astounding  and not fast enough   he says  CEPI wants to be in a position to make a vaccine for emerging threats within     days   mRNA is an essential  critical component of our being able to achieve that mission   Hatchett says CEPI s other goal is to improve access to mRNA vaccines  which still need to be stored and transported at extremely cold temperatures      C for Pfizer BioNtech      C for Moderna   which makes reaching remote areas challenging  The cold chain requirement and the cost are two reasons the majority of mRNA vaccines have been purchased and administered by higher income countries  In India     percent of people received the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine  which is based on a different technology  doesn t need to be kept so cold  and has been made available far more cheaply  in the US the overwhelming majority got mRNA vaccines That problem will never go away completely mRNA is inherently unstable  Karik  says  to the point that vaccine shipments can be ruined by a bumpy road but there is a trade off between temperature and shelf life  you can store vaccines at less extreme temperatures  but they will degrade faster   In some parts of the world  this is not the most convenient presentation   Miller says  Although mRNA could eventually be cheaper than traditional vaccine manufacturing  that s not the case today and ensuring equitable access could require some technical breakthroughs  Dieffenbach suggests freeze drying vaccine particles for easier transport and storage as one potential solution eventually mRNA could be squirted up the nose  inhaled as a powder  or applied using a patch  Self amplifying RNA  which replicates itself inside the body  could enable lower doses  which could lessen the risk of side effects Eventually  protection against multiple strains of a virus could be administered in a single shot  There are efforts to make universal vaccines for coronaviruses or influenza that would target their stable features like the stalk of an influenza virus getting around their ability to shift and mutate   Even for those coronaviruses that are still in the bat and have not jumped to us  we will be protected   Karik  says Or  if that doesn t work  there s also the  sledgehammer  approach of putting multiple strains of mRNA into a single jab a whole manual of instructions the body can use to recognize different strains of a virus   Our goal ultimately is to develop these individual antigens but combine them in ways that if you re getting a seasonal booster you don t need to get multiple  you can get a single booster to cover against the most likely respiratory pathogens   Miller says  A future mRNA flu jab the most likely next step after Covid could comprise specific instructions for that season s most prevalent strain  but also primers for various different strains so that if there is a pandemic of  say  H N  flu  people s immune systems won t be going into it completely blind There s a world of applications beyond vaccines  too  Messenger RNA gives scientists and doctors a way to make essentially any protein they would like directly inside the body  Rather than coding for a spike protein to encourage the body to make antibodies against it  mRNA could be used to teach the body how to make those antibodies directly  Someone who survived an outbreak of an emerging disease could have their antibodies cloned  and the instructions for how to make them could be shared with others using mRNA  suggests Karik  Years ago  she made a list of all the diseases she thought it was reasonable to treat using mRNA  There were more than    on the list  covering everything from cancer to everyday aches and pains  The design of the lipid coating that surrounds the mRNA could be tweaked to get the molecule to different places in the body  the lungs  the spleen  the bone marrow  depending on the exact condition or disease that needs to be treated A protein that aids healing applied directly to a wound will wash away in hours with the flow of blood  But mRNA could be used to teach the cells in the wounded area to make and secrete that protein themselves  The body of a child with a genetic defect that means they can t make a vital protein could be taught to make that protein  with mRNA instructions sent precisely to the area where it s needed  We always wanted it to be that everybody could use it   says Karik   from a hotel room in Tokyo  where she s quarantining before a meeting with the Emperor of Japan a sign of the global impact mRNA has already had  But we ve only scratched the surface  If the logistical and technical hurdles can be overcome  and the technology can be distributed evenly  mRNA has the potential to transform every strand of medicine   In the next    years  you will see unbelievable progress   she says Updated                pm ET  This story was corrected to state that the letters of mRNA are nucleotides  not amino acids  and that it was the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  not CEPI  that funded the development of an mRNA vaccine for Zika in       More From WIREDContact       Cond  Nast  All rights reserved  Use of this site

seems to have been mysteriously spared  Central and Western Africa  My colleague  Stephanie Nolen  traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic It s Thursday  April   So  Stephanie  you re a global health reporter at The Times  Tell me about the kind of reporting that you ve been doing during the pandemic So  generally  a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world  things like infectious disease  malaria  tuberculosis  H I V  But of course  in the Covid era  that s mostly meant reporting on Covid  And I ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world  And in February  I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries  and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven t paid as much attention to in the pandemic So I arrived in Freetown  the capital of Sierra Leone  at what was the height of the Omicron wave  And I was coming from Canada  which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic  And I hired a vehicle with a driver  and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests  And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there  and it was really startling We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying  There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it  Nobody had a mask on  And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people  are you worried about Covid  I mean  they knew what I was talking about  but they couldn t fathom why I would be concerned  It was like time travel back to       like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow And right away  I thought  I need to understand what s happening here  Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here  Or it is here  but it s not making people sick  It s not killing people  And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months  this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa  but until I saw it  I really didn t understand just how puzzling this was  And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery Stephanie  to that point  what s the big picture here  I mean  tell me what s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic  Catch me up on how it s played out So I ll start with South Africa because that s the country in sub Saharan Africa that we know the most about  So South Africa  of course  has had a pretty rough time  The Beta variant was first identified there  The Omicron variant was first identified there  They ve caused bad waves  We know that there have been probably         deaths caused by Covid in South Africa As you move through the continent  it gets murkier  East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya  Uganda  There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full  But they re rare stories  And as you move into Central and then Western Africa  there have been even fewer reports like this  right  Much  much lower reports of deaths  Sierra Leone is a country of   million people  and they ve reported a total of       Covid cases and just     deaths That seems incredibly low It really is So how did you start to answer that question  Stephanie  The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid  What did you do first So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases  And the town that I was in  Kamakwie  happened to have the regional Covid coordinator s office there  So I went across town and walked into the office And it was completely empty  except for the district coordinator  the Covid coordinator  who I found sitting behind his desk  all alone in an otherwise completely empty office  He had a shiny new laptop in front of him  but no internet connection and  indeed  no power  And when I asked him what he knew about cases  he told me really proudly that they d only had    since the start of the pandemic Oh  wow     for roughly what kind of population Oh  it s about         people in this district Wow So that was kind of shocking  But then the question was  well  how do you know  So I asked him what was happening with testing  And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital  So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital  thinking  OK  maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing This is the hospital of the same region It s the district hospital serving those         people  And there was a lab  and there were three busy technicians in that lab  And when I said  what are you doing in terms of Covid testing  they were pretty blunt  There s not a lot of resources in this hospital  So what they do when people come in is they triage  They test first for malaria  And if you don t have malaria  they ll test you for typhoid  And if you don t have typhoid  then they ll test you for Covid  And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point  they figured out what they have So  Stephanie  it sounds like from your reporting what you re finding is that  number one  the regional coordinator is not doing the testing  And number two  at the hospital  they have so many other urgent diseases  malaria  for example  that Covid is just really the last thing on their list Exactly  There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country  So I went back down south to Freetown  to the capital  And I went to see Dr  Austin Demby  who is the health minister of Sierra Leone  And I went into his office in the ministry So I cover global health for The Times  And I am meant to travel the world  although  obviously  the last couple of years  that has not been a thing And told him why I was in Sierra Leone I would love to hear from you how it s been going and what the challenges are Yeah  so thank you very much  And by the way And he told me about how he used to work for the C D C  in the United States  And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister I was appointed on the   th of February last year And that was peak pandemic  So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point  But also And on the   th  Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak  just a couple of days after Dr  Demby came back to take up this job  an Ebola outbreak was declared Oh  wow So this is a guy who really knows a thing or two about pandemics The lessons learned from Ebola are extremely helpful  I mean And we started off by talking a little bit about                 when that last really terrible Ebola outbreak  you might remember  went through this region         people died  It was really devastating for Sierra Leone When we had Ebola here  people knew what hand sanitizing was  People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever  social distancing  People knew about care And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid So that gives us a headstart  And what that meant was Sierra Leone was the last country in Africa to report a case  And Sierra Leone has constantly reported very  very low numbers throughout all of this outbreak And when I started asking Dr  Demby about Covid  he attributed some of their low case numbers to the fact that they d been able to very quickly mount a strong response But then how does Dr  Demby explain the things that you were seeing in your reporting  Stephanie  I mean  in the regional coordinator s office  in the hospital  this fact that people didn t seem to be doing any testing Right  so I asked him about that Can I ask you about that  Because it s quite extraordinary for me to come  I live in Canada  and to travel from a place where people are pandemic obsessed  right  to a place where it s clearly not on people s minds  How confident are you in your surveillance I said  what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here  How much are you testing  How much are you looking So that s a really interesting point  Again  you have to be careful with this  but I think most of the testing that s occurring is occurring at the airport  which is more entry and exit  you know And he acknowledged freely that there s very little testing happening And so when we say we have silent districts  they re silent either because there are no cases or because we re not testing them  yeah  But I have a feeling that there s a lot of transmission going on in here So it sounds like the health minister of Sierra Leone is confirming the theory that cases are being severely undercounted Yeah  definitely There was a survey that was done a while back that indicated close to    percent of people have been exposed Do you believe it Oh  yeah  yeah  I mean  this is a study that was done by Tulane And in fact  he told me about some recent research that had looked for antibody levels in the population and had found that probably half the people in Sierra Leone when that study was done had already been exposed to Covid I think we re looking at doing another survey now to look at the antibody levels in the country  But I would not be surprised if it s very  very high And Stephanie  is there other data to back that up Well  there is  actually  There s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two thirds of people across sub Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies  There s other data sources  looking particularly at West Africa  that show that    percent of people have got Covid antibodies  And remember  when these studies were done  only   percent    percent    percent of people had had access to vaccination  So if you ve got antibodies  it s because you had an infection So that kind of answers your original question  right  Clearly  a lot of people in Sierra Leone did have Covid Yeah  absolutely  And in fact  Dr  Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation  They know lots of people have been infected However  I m buoyed by the fact that no matter what there is  there s no evident excess deaths that are occurring that s very visible But he also talked about something else they re seeing  or actually  what they re not seeing  He was just totally adamant that they re not seeing the death rates that we ve seen in other parts of the world Everybody else  there are multiple waves in Italy now  in Germany  everywhere else  People are still dying in the U S  But when you look here  you see that people are still getting sick  We re still getting cases  But you don t get the kind of enormity that others are seeing And remember  Sierra Leone has this surveillance system that s a legacy of that terrible Ebola outbreak The thing is we also have a very active surveillance system  Every week  we got reports of all of the deaths around And he says  look  if there was a spike in deaths in one region of this country anywhere  we would know about it  and it s just not happening We haven t seen any excess mortality that could alert us that there s something going on Hmm  Interesting  So it sounds like  Stephanie  from what you re saying  Sierra Leone and a lot of sub Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic  But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies  had Covid  And if we follow what happened in the U S   they should have a lot of deaths  right  But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died Well  so there I am with a whole new mystery  right  If lots of people have Covid  but they don t have deaths to report  what s going on We ll be right back So  Stephanie  how did you go about digging into this other part of the mystery  which had to do with how many people in Sierra Leone actually died of Covid So I started calling up epidemiologists in all different parts of sub Saharan Africa  people I ve known for a long while  And I started asking them this question of  what do you think is happening  And after a lot of conversations  I kind of was left with two really different theories that would explain how even though we know there are lots of Covid infections in Sierra Leone and other countries in the region  how it could be that people don t seem to be dying And what are those theories  Lay those out for me Well  the first one is that there is no mystery  There s just lousy data on deaths  There s not some miraculous thing happening in West and Central Africa or in regions that report lower Covid deaths  The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them  And the second theory is that  in fact  there s no way that thousands and millions of deaths have been missed  Something else is protecting people  Something else is going on that means people are getting infected with Covid  but they don t get sick or they don t die at the same rates OK  so let s start with the first theory because that one seems pretty logical to me  I mean  if it s clear that cases were being undercounted  then probably deaths were being undercounted  right Yeah  I think this is a really strong argument  We know that death registration in much of sub Saharan Africa is really  really poorly done  There are a lot of countries where only    or    of deaths are ever registered with a civil authority Oh  wow People don t typically die in medical facilities or hospitals  They most often will die at home  And they get buried in a small village graveyard  And so that death never gets reported  An excellent Zambian public health researcher I spoke to told me about a study he s been doing that found that nearly     of the bodies in the main morgue in Zambia were positive for Covid This was at the height of the Delta wave  And he said  look  there s just no reason to think that fewer Zambians would be dying or Ethiopians or Sierra Leoneans  right  There s no inherent reason why there would be fewer deaths here  just the record keeping is really weak And there s a model that draws together lots and lots of different data sets that the economist has been running that says there could be up to three million Covid excess deaths in sub Saharan Africa Oh  wow  So three million deaths that basically have been uncounted That s the argument  Now  look  to be clear  that model says the deaths have been undercounted all over the world  We know that that s true  But according to this model  the problem of undercounting is the most severe in Africa And does that hold water Well  a lot of people that I spoke to say there s no question some deaths have been missed  but they re really not buying it  And that includes the chief of the Covid response for the W H O   the World Health Organization in sub Saharan Africa  He said to me there s just no way  there s just no way that we have missed millions of deaths  Models are useful to a point  but there are lots of other ways of seeing deaths  right When Zambia had a bad Delta wave  there were bodies stacked outside the morgue  I mean  a place like Sierra Leone holds really  really big funerals  People say there s just no way that there could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths and that we ve just missed them And Stephanie  if it were true that there were high case numbers  but low deaths from Covid in Sierra Leone  what would explain that Well  that is an excellent question  So  again  there are lots of theories  The leading one  and I think that whatever else is true  this is a part of it  is age  right  Sub Saharan Africa has a median age of     right  Sierra Leone is right around that as well  And that compares with    in Europe     in the United States  And so we know that Covid is much more deadly for older people who have lived long enough to have developed the co morbidities  such as diabetes  that makes Covid really deadly  The virus is far less likely to kill young people  And they re often asymptomatic altogether Another argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with temperature  the fact that it s  obviously  really quite warm in all of these countries  and people mostly live their life outdoors  Obviously  if you re talking about people who are in Sierra Leone  primarily subsistence farmers spending the day in their fields  they re not getting exposed to Covid the way they would on a crowded subway train  although  of course  now we know that huge numbers of people actually have been infected  So that theory is a bit questionable And then finally  the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid  or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone  you ve had repeated bouts of malaria  You ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease  that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid Hmm  That s interesting  And how do these three factors hold up when you compare Sierra Leone to another similar country that had a really bad time with Covid Well  we can talk about India  India has reported half a million Covid deaths  but it s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to   million people who ve died of the virus  So India also has a young population  right  There  the median age is about     It s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors  And there s regions of India that have very high rates of infection with malaria  There are lots of other pathogens in circulation  so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things So we know that those factors were not protective in India  On the other hand  India is a much more dense place  It s much more connected  It has much better transportation  So it s not a straight comparison to Sierra Leone  but it s enough to suggest that those three things alone don t cover it as an explanation So it sounds like what India is showing us is that these factors you re talking about  they re all playing something of a role  but there s not a single one of them that solves the mystery entirely Yeah  that s exactly right So I m wondering  Stephanie  in all the reporting you ve done  how do you even begin to figure out what s true  I mean  is it that Covid deaths in Africa are really being undercounted  or that Africans have this really unique immunity to Covid Where I wound up is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle  If you re in a place like Sierra Leone that has incredibly high infant mortality  it has the highest maternal mortality in the world  Thousands of people die of malaria  There is all kinds of other infectious diseases that people are prey to  It is possible that Covid could cause a rise in the number of deaths that wouldn t necessarily show up the way it would in a country with overall lower mortality figures On the other hand  I believe people in Sierra Leone when they say to me  there have been no extra deaths in my village this year  One person died  two people died  It s just like all the other years  Nothing unusual has happened here Right What I can also tell you is that I was able to sit down and read all of the serious research on the topic in a single morning  It s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters  right  It matters for Sierra Leone  for sub Saharan Africa  but it also matters to everybody else What are the stakes  Stephanie  Why does it matter Well  it matters for a couple of reasons  In terms of why it matters for the world  if there is something going on that means people really aren t getting sick with Covid or aren t dying from Covid at the same rate in West and Central Africa  in sub Saharan Africa as a whole  understanding where that protection  where that immunity is coming from  that could help us in lots of ways  It could help develop better treatments  It could help with another generation of vaccines So it matters for protecting the world  but it also matters for sub Saharan Africa  for Sierra Leone  There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate    percent of people  And Sierra Leone is scrambling to do that Well  you have now a situation where COVAX came through  The World Bank came through with funding that allowed us to buy about    million worth of vaccines When I spoke to the health minister  Dr  Demby  he was talking about how there s a lot of resources coming into the country right now to do Covid vaccination  But At the same time we have the Ebola vaccination going on  there was a polio outbreak  So all of this was going on at the same time  The same staff was doing all of this That is an enormous challenge in a place like Sierra Leone with a health system that was already really struggling to respond to what people needed And not only that  you had to raise awareness  bring people in  and vaccinate them And then trying to convince young healthy people to get a shot for a disease that  as we ve just been talking about  they really don t think as a risk to them It becomes a real burden when people are not sick So it sounds like there s this tension here  right  I mean  public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate    percent of Africa  But Dr  Demby is finding that that s a really complicated thing to do  and especially complicated when it s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country I think there s a growing  it started as a whisper and then a mutter  and now it s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to    percent in sub Saharan Africa makes sense  whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources My responsibility is  how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid  but at the same time  be a resource for rebuilding health systems I think all things being equal  Dr  Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn t killing people now  the next variant might be deadly  But The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world  And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system  he s facing these trade offs  I would say there are artificial trade offs between addressing one disease or another  And so he s in this position where he s having to really ask himself  what should he do with the limited resources that he has Stephanie  thank you It s a pleasure We ll be right back Here s what else you need to know today On Wednesday  in response to atrocities in the war in Ukraine  the United States and its allies moved to impose full sanctions against Russia s largest financial institutions The Biden administration  together with the European Union  imposed strict sanctions against Sberbank  the largest financial institution in Russia  which holds over a third of the country s financial assets  and Alfa Bank  one of the country s largest private banks  The administration also announced that it would block access to U S  held financial assets for family members and close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin  including Putin s two adult daughters And Pentagon officials said that Russia has withdrawn all of its troops from the territory around Kyiv  Ukraine s capital  and Chernihiv  a major city in the north  Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago  but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self proclaimed pullout could be a ruse  As many as        Russian troops have now left the territory and are rearming and resupplying before launching what Western officials believe will be a renewed focus on Ukraine s east and south Meanwhile  a video posted online and verified by The New York Times appears to show Ukrainian mistreatment of Russian prisoners  In the video  a Russian soldier can be seen with a jacket pulled over his head  gasping for air  before he is shot by a Ukrainian soldier  At least three other men believed to be Russian soldiers lay dead beside him  one with his hands tied behind his back Today s episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja  Rikki Novetsky and Rob Szypko  with help

That s it for The Daily  I m Sabrina Tavernise  See you tomorrow transcriptFrom The New York Times  I m Sabrina Tavernise  This is The Daily Throughout the pandemic  as countries have struggled with disease and death  one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared  Central and Western Africa  My colleague  Stephanie Nolen  traveled to Sierra Leone to investigate why that is and what it tells us about the future of the pandemic It s Thursday  April   So  Stephanie  you re a global health reporter at The Times  Tell me about the kind of reporting that you ve been doing during the pandemic So  generally  a global health reporter looks at the big health problems that cut across regions of the world  things like infectious disease  malaria  tuberculosis  H I V  But of course  in the Covid era  that s mostly meant reporting on Covid  And I ve been doing a lot of reporting in particular on vaccination and on the efforts to try to vaccinate the world  And in February  I took a trip in Sierra Leone where I was hoping to figure out what was happening in some of the least vaccinated countries  and also to do some reporting on some of the other issues we haven t paid as much attention to in the pandemic So I arrived in Freetown  the capital of Sierra Leone  at what was the height of the Omicron wave  And I was coming from Canada  which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic  And I hired a vehicle with a driver  and I kitted it out with masks and hand sanitizer and rapid tests  And we headed up to the northwest of the country the first day I was there  and it was really startling We saw there was a big rock concert in the town where we were staying  There was a big football tournament with people packed in to watch it  Nobody had a mask on  And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people  are you worried about Covid  I mean  they knew what I was talking about  but they couldn t fathom why I would be concerned  It was like time travel back to       like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow And right away  I thought  I need to understand what s happening here  Is it that Covid for some reason is just not here  Or it is here  but it s not making people sick  It s not killing people  And I had been reading debate about this in journals for months  this question of what was happening with Covid in Africa  but until I saw it  I really didn t understand just how puzzling this was  And I very quickly decided to put aside some of what I had come to Sierra Leone to report on to try to really dig into this mystery Stephanie  to that point  what s the big picture here  I mean  tell me what s been happening in different parts of Africa during the pandemic  Catch me up on how it s played out So I ll start with South Africa because that s the country in sub Saharan Africa that we know the most about  So South Africa  of course  has had a pretty rough time  The Beta variant was first identified there  The Omicron variant was first identified there  They ve caused bad waves  We know that there have been probably         deaths caused by Covid in South Africa As you move through the continent  it gets murkier  East Africa has reported some bad waves in countries such as Kenya  Uganda  There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full  But they re rare stories  And as you move into Central and then Western Africa  there have been even fewer reports like this  right  Much  much lower reports of deaths  Sierra Leone is a country of   million people  and they ve reported a total of       Covid cases and just     deaths That seems incredibly low It really is So how did you start to answer that question  Stephanie  The question of why Sierra Leone seemed less affected by Covid  What did you do first So the first thing I wanted to try and understand was what was happening with cases  And the town that I was in  Kamakwie  happened to have the regional Covid coordinator s office there  So I went across town and walked into the office And it was completely empty  except for the district coordinator  the Covid coordinator  who I found sitting behind his desk  all alone in an otherwise completely empty office  He had a shiny new laptop in front of him  but no internet connection and  indeed  no power  And when I asked him what he knew about cases  he told me really proudly that they d only had    since the start of the pandemic Oh  wow     for roughly what kind of population Oh  it s about         people in this district Wow So that was kind of shocking  But then the question was  well  how do you know  So I asked him what was happening with testing  And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital  So I went from there a couple of miles away to the hospital  thinking  OK  maybe somebody else can tell me more about testing This is the hospital of the same region It s the district hospital serving those         people  And there was a lab  and there were three busy technicians in that lab  And when I said  what are you doing in terms of Covid testing  they were pretty blunt  There s not a lot of resources in this hospital  So what they do when people come in is they triage  They test first for malaria  And if you don t have malaria  they ll test you for typhoid  And if you don t have typhoid  then they ll test you for Covid  And so they never really need to test anyone for Covid because before they get to that point  they figured out what they have So  Stephanie  it sounds like from your reporting what you re finding is that  number one  the regional coordinator is not doing the testing  And number two  at the hospital  they have so many other urgent diseases  malaria  for example  that Covid is just really the last thing on their list Exactly  There was no way talking to these regional authorities that I was going to be able to get a good sense of the actual scale of Covid infection in the country  So I went back down south to Freetown  to the capital  And I went to see Dr  Austin Demby  who is the health minister of Sierra Leone  And I went into his office in the ministry So I cover global health for The Times  And I am meant to travel the world  although  obviously  the last couple of years  that has not been a thing And told him why I was in Sierra Leone I would love to hear from you how it s been going and what the challenges are Yeah  so thank you very much  And by the way And he told me about how he used to work for the C D C  in the United States  And he came home just a year ago to take up the job of minister I was appointed on the   th of February last year And that was peak pandemic  So no vaccination had happened in Sierra Leone at that point  But also And on the   th  Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak  just a couple of days after Dr  Demby came back to take up this job  an Ebola outbreak was declared Oh  wow So this is a guy who really knows a thing or two about pandemics The lessons learned from Ebola are extremely helpful  I mean And we started off by talking a little bit about                 when that last really terrible Ebola outbreak  you might remember  went through this region         people died  It was really devastating for Sierra Leone When we had Ebola here  people knew what hand sanitizing was  People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever  social distancing  People knew about care And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid So that gives us a headstart  And what that meant was Sierra Leone was the last country in Africa to report a case  And Sierra Leone has constantly reported very  very low numbers throughout all of this outbreak And when I started asking Dr  Demby about Covid  he attributed some of their low case numbers to the fact that they d been able to very quickly mount a strong response But then how does Dr  Demby explain the things that you were seeing in your reporting  Stephanie  I mean  in the regional coordinator s office  in the hospital  this fact that people didn t seem to be doing any testing Right  so I asked him about that Can I ask you about that  Because it s quite extraordinary for me to come  I live in Canada  and to travel from a place where people are pandemic obsessed  right  to a place where it s clearly not on people s minds  How confident are you in your surveillance I said  what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here  How much are you testing  How much are you looking So that s a really interesting point  Again  you have to be careful with this  but I think most of the testing that s occurring is occurring at the airport  which is more entry and exit  you know And he acknowledged freely that there s very little testing happening And so when we say we have silent districts  they re silent either because there are no cases or because we re not testing them  yeah  But I have a feeling that there s a lot of transmission going on in here So it sounds like the health minister of Sierra Leone is confirming the theory that cases are being severely undercounted Yeah  definitely There was a survey that was done a while back that indicated close to    percent of people have been exposed Do you believe it Oh  yeah  yeah  I mean  this is a study that was done by Tulane And in fact  he told me about some recent research that had looked for antibody levels in the population and had found that probably half the people in Sierra Leone when that study was done had already been exposed to Covid I think we re looking at doing another survey now to look at the antibody levels in the country  But I would not be surprised if it s very  very high And Stephanie  is there other data to back that up Well  there is  actually  There s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two thirds of people across sub Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies  There s other data sources  looking particularly at West Africa  that show that    percent of people have got Covid antibodies  And remember  when these studies were done  only   percent    percent    percent of people had had access to vaccination  So if you ve got antibodies  it s because you had an infection So that kind of answers your original question  right  Clearly  a lot of people in Sierra Leone did have Covid Yeah  absolutely  And in fact  Dr  Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation  They know lots of people have been infected However  I m buoyed by the fact that no matter what there is  there s no evident excess deaths that are occurring that s very visible But he also talked about something else they re seeing  or actually  what they re not seeing  He was just totally adamant that they re not seeing the death rates that we ve seen in other parts of the world Everybody else  there are multiple waves in Italy now  in Germany  everywhere else  People are still dying in the U S  But when you look here  you see that people are still getting sick  We re still getting cases  But you don t get the kind of enormity that others are seeing And remember  Sierra Leone has this surveillance system that s a legacy of that terrible Ebola outbreak The thing is we also have a very active surveillance system  Every week  we got reports of all of the deaths around And he says  look  if there was a spike in deaths in one region of this country anywhere  we would know about it  and it s just not happening We haven t seen any excess mortality that could alert us that there s something going on Hmm  Interesting  So it sounds like  Stephanie  from what you re saying  Sierra Leone and a lot of sub Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic  But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies  had Covid  And if we follow what happened in the U S   they should have a lot of deaths  right  But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died Well  so there I am with a whole new mystery  right  If lots of people have Covid  but they don t have deaths to report  what s going on We ll be right back So  Stephanie  how did you go about digging into this other part of the mystery  which had to do with how many people in Sierra Leone actually died of Covid So I started calling up epidemiologists in all different parts of sub Saharan Africa  people I ve known for a long while  And I started asking them this question of  what do you think is happening  And after a lot of conversations  I kind of was left with two really different theories that would explain how even though we know there are lots of Covid infections in Sierra Leone and other countries in the region  how it could be that people don t seem to be dying And what are those theories  Lay those out for me Well  the first one is that there is no mystery  There s just lousy data on deaths  There s not some miraculous thing happening in West and Central Africa or in regions that report lower Covid deaths  The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them  And the second theory is that  in fact  there s no way that thousands and millions of deaths have been missed  Something else is protecting people  Something else is going on that means people are getting infected with Covid  but they don t get sick or they don t die at the same rates OK  so let s start with the first theory because that one seems pretty logical to me  I mean  if it s clear that cases were being undercounted  then probably deaths were being undercounted  right Yeah  I think this is a really strong argument  We know that death registration in much of sub Saharan Africa is really  really poorly done  There are a lot of countries where only    or    of deaths are ever registered with a civil authority Oh  wow People don t typically die in medical facilities or hospitals  They most often will die at home  And they get buried in a small village graveyard  And so that death never gets reported  An excellent Zambian public health researcher I spoke to told me about a study he s been doing that found that nearly     of the bodies in the main morgue in Zambia were positive for Covid This was at the height of the Delta wave  And he said  look  there s just no reason to think that fewer Zambians would be dying or Ethiopians or Sierra Leoneans  right  There s no inherent reason why there would be fewer deaths here  just the record keeping is really weak And there s a model that draws together lots and lots of different data sets that the economist has been running that says there could be up to three million Covid excess deaths in sub Saharan Africa Oh  wow  So three million deaths that basically have been uncounted That s the argument  Now  look  to be clear  that model says the deaths have been undercounted all over the world  We know that that s true  But according to this model  the problem of undercounting is the most severe in Africa And does that hold water Well  a lot of people that I spoke to say there s no question some deaths have been missed  but they re really not buying it  And that includes the chief of the Covid response for the W H O   the World Health Organization in sub Saharan Africa  He said to me there s just no way  there s just no way that we have missed millions of deaths  Models are useful to a point  but there are lots of other ways of seeing deaths  right When Zambia had a bad Delta wave  there were bodies stacked outside the morgue  I mean  a place like Sierra Leone holds really  really big funerals  People say there s just no way that there could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths and that we ve just missed them And Stephanie  if it were true that there were high case numbers  but low deaths from Covid in Sierra Leone  what would explain that Well  that is an excellent question  So  again  there are lots of theories  The leading one  and I think that whatever else is true  this is a part of it  is age  right  Sub Saharan Africa has a median age of     right  Sierra Leone is right around that as well  And that compares with    in Europe     in the United States  And so we know that Covid is much more deadly for older people who have lived long enough to have developed the co morbidities  such as diabetes  that makes Covid really deadly  The virus is far less likely to kill young people  And they re often asymptomatic altogether Another argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with temperature  the fact that it s  obviously  really quite warm in all of these countries  and people mostly live their life outdoors  Obviously  if you re talking about people who are in Sierra Leone  primarily subsistence farmers spending the day in their fields  they re not getting exposed to Covid the way they would on a crowded subway train  although  of course  now we know that huge numbers of people actually have been infected  So that theory is a bit questionable And then finally  the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid  or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone  you ve had repeated bouts of malaria  You ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease  that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid Hmm  That s interesting  And how do these three factors hold up when you compare Sierra Leone to another similar country that had a really bad time with Covid Well  we can talk about India  India has reported half a million Covid deaths  but it s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to   million people who ve died of the virus  So India also has a young population  right  There  the median age is about     It s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors  And there s regions of India that have very high rates of infection with malaria  There are lots of other pathogens in circulation  so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things So we know that those factors were not protective in India  On the other hand  India is a much more dense place  It s much more connected  It has much better transportation  So it s not a straight comparison to Sierra Leone  but it s enough to suggest that those three things alone don t cover it as an explanation So it sounds like what India is showing us is that these factors you re talking about  they re all playing something of a role  but there s not a single one of them that solves the mystery entirely Yeah  that s exactly right So I m wondering  Stephanie  in all the reporting you ve done  how do you even begin to figure out what s true  I mean  is it that Covid deaths in Africa are really being undercounted  or that Africans have this really unique immunity to Covid Where I wound up is that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle  If you re in a place like Sierra Leone that has incredibly high infant mortality  it has the highest maternal mortality in the world  Thousands of people die of malaria  There is all kinds of other infectious diseases that people are prey to  It is possible that Covid could cause a rise in the number of deaths that wouldn t necessarily show up the way it would in a country with overall lower mortality figures On the other hand  I believe people in Sierra Leone when they say to me  there have been no extra deaths in my village this year  One person died  two people died  It s just like all the other years  Nothing unusual has happened here Right What I can also tell you is that I was able to sit down and read all of the serious research on the topic in a single morning  It s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters  right  It matters for Sierra Leone  for sub Saharan Africa  but it also matters to everybody else What are the stakes  Stephanie  Why does it matter Well  it matters for a couple of reasons  In terms of why it matters for the world  if there is something going on that means people really aren t getting sick with Covid or aren t dying from Covid at the same rate in West and Central Africa  in sub Saharan Africa as a whole  understanding where that protection  where that immunity is coming from  that could help us in lots of ways  It could help develop better treatments  It could help with another generation of vaccines So it matters for protecting the world  but it also matters for sub Saharan Africa  for Sierra Leone  There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate    percent of people  And Sierra Leone is scrambling to do that Well  you have now a situation where COVAX came through  The World Bank came through with funding that allowed us to buy about    million worth of vaccines When I spoke to the health minister  Dr  Demby  he was talking about how there s a lot of resources coming into the country right now to do Covid vaccination  But At the same time we have the Ebola vaccination going on  there was a polio outbreak  So all of this was going on at the same time  The same staff was doing all of this That is an enormous challenge in a place like Sierra Leone with a health system that was already really struggling to respond to what people needed And not only that  you had to raise awareness  bring people in  and vaccinate them And then trying to convince young healthy people to get a shot for a disease that  as we ve just been talking about  they really don t think as a risk to them It becomes a real burden when people are not sick So it sounds like there s this tension here  right  I mean  public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate    percent of Africa  But Dr  Demby is finding that that s a really complicated thing to do  and especially complicated when it s not even clear how much of a threat Covid is to this country I think there s a growing  it started as a whisper and then a mutter  and now it s a kind of out loud conversation about whether getting to    percent in sub Saharan Africa makes sense  whether pouring resources into vaccination in a place like Sierra Leone really is the best use of those resources My responsibility is  how do I utilize the services that I intended for Covid to address Covid  but at the same time  be a resource for rebuilding health systems I think all things being equal  Dr  Demby would really like for his people to be protected from Covid because even if the virus isn t killing people now  the next variant might be deadly  But The other diseases are not going to wait for you to resolve these issues for too long He also has hospital wards that are full of people with malaria and the highest maternal mortality rate in the world  And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system  he s facing these trade offs  I would say there are artificial trade offs between addressing one disease or another  And so he s in this position where he s having to really ask himself  what should he do with the limited resources that he has Stephanie  thank you It s a pleasure We ll be right back Here s

United States  The vast majority of the country has low community levels of Covid     according to calculations performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are designed to assess the number of new cases in a community and the strain on its hospitals  a point also made on Sunday by Dr  Anthony S  Fauci  President Biden s top pandemic adviser  Right now that is showing an uptick  but not showing substantial changes in what we should be doing   Dr  Jha said on CNN  referring to the C D C  framework   And I think the C D C  policy is right on this  And while he praised the role of at home tests  Dr  Jha acknowledged many of those results may go unreported  underpinning  he said  the importance of hospitalizations as a metric Dr  Jha s tenure begins as a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant  known as BA    has become the dominant version among new U S  cases  As of Sunday  the United States was averaging more than        cases a day  an increase of   percent over the past two weeks  according to a New York Times database  just a fraction of the height of the Omicron winter surge Still  New York City and Washington  D C   are among the places seeing steeper increases than the nation overall  though their average numbers of new cases remain far lower than recent peaks  too  Prominent officials in both cities  such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mayor Eric Adams of New York  have tested positive in recent days  as have some Broadway stars On Monday  the White House press secretary  Jen Psaki  said that both Mr  Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had tested negative in the last    hours  Ms  Harris had been considered a close contact of her communications director  who tested positive last week  but the vice president was now five days post exposure  Ms  Psaki said A handful of colleges and universities in the country have reinstated mask mandates as they battle outbreaks on campus  On Monday  the city of Philadelphia announced it would soon reinstate an indoor mask mandate This chart shows how reported cases per capita have changed in different parts of the country  The state with the highest recent cases per capita is shown And after the Gridiron Club and Foundation s annual dinner in Washington on April    at least    attendees tested positive  Tom DeFrank  a contributing editor for National Journal and president of the Gridiron Club  said in an email on Monday afternoon  The number of new cases reported each day has been declining  he said  adding that reported symptoms remain mild  with several asymptomatic cases  Now that we are nine days after the dinner  the connection between a new positive test and our dinner is certainly arguable  particularly for public officials who have had a full week of public events   Mr  DeFrank said in a statement  What it reminds us is the pandemic isn t over   Dr  Jha said on  Good Morning America   referring to the number of cases after the Gridiron dinner  which included some Cabinet members   We are still going to see cases of this virus spreading  And we have to continue to be vigilant  We have to continue to be careful  Neither Mr  Biden nor Ms  Pelosi attended the Gridiron dinner  and Ms  Pelosi said on Monday that she would be leaving isolation on Tuesday after testing negative on Monday Elsewhere in the House  Representative Rashida Tlaib said on Monday she had tested positive  In Connecticut  the lieutenant governor  Susan Bysiewicz  said she tested positive  too Dr  Jha also told the  Today  show that the C D C  would get the final say on the future of the mask mandate on airplanes and other public transportation   but said that extending the requirement  which currently goes through at least April      is absolutely on the table  Dr  Jha replaced

U S  consulate employees and their families to leave Shanghai as a lockdown aimed at containing a surge in Omicron coronavirus cases stretched into its second week China s  zero tolerance approach to Covid      the travel advisory issued on Monday said   severely impacts travel and access to public services  The move came after the department had  on Friday  authorized those individuals to depart the area  adding that Americans should avoid traveling to China because of its  arbitrary enforcement of local laws and Covid    related restrictions   The movement from  authorized  to  ordered  departure means that we are now mandating that certain employees depart Shanghai rather than making this decision voluntary   the U S  Embassy and Consulates in China said in a statement  adding that the employees and families will depart on commercial flights  Our change in posture reflects our assessment that it is best for our employees and their families to be reduced in number and our operations to be scaled down   the agency said The American Citizen Services Unit  as the consular services office of the U S  Consulate General in Shanghai is known  has been closed since March     the agency said Under a lockdown that began on April    residents of Shanghai  a city of    million people  have struggled to arrange food deliveries  Some residents have shouted out their windows  demanding to be given supplies  Shanghai recorded about        new symptomatic and asymptomatic cases on Sunday  China s National Health Commission said on Monday  accounting for more than    percent of about        cases that the health authorities recorded throughout mainland China The State Department has advised Americans not to travel to Hong Kong because of the restrictions imposed by the city under the direction of the central Chinese government  as the Chinese territory has struggled to contain the wave of cases there In both Shanghai and Hong Kong  the department said  some children had been separated from their parents to be quarantined or isolated  although the Shanghai government has begun allowing children with special needs to quarantine with their families The White House

month after lifting it  becoming the first major U S  city to do so  This is our chance to get ahead of the pandemic   said Cheryl Bettigole  the city s health commissioner  in a news conference  She acknowledged that the average number of daily new cases  currently at      is still nowhere near what it was at the beginning of the year  when the Omicron variant was pushing the seven day average to nearly       But she said that if the city failed to require masks now   knowing that every previous wave of infections has been followed by a wave of hospitalizations  and then a wave of deaths  then it will be too late for many of our residents   Over the past week  the city reported that the number of residents who had died of Covid    passed       The mandate will go into effect next week  A spokesman for the city s health department said it would end when case numbers and rates go beneath a certain threshold The decision comes as cases are ticking up across the country  fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant  known as BA    While the national increase is so far relatively small   about   percent over the last two weeks   the growth in cases in Northeastern cities like New York City and Washington  D C   has been significantly steeper  Some colleges in the Northeast  including Columbia  Georgetown and Johns Hopkins  have reinstated indoor mask mandates in recent days Speaking at a virtual news conference on Monday afternoon  Mayor Eric Adams of New York City said that he would follow the advice of his health team in making any determination on reinstating mask mandates in spite of his positive test result on Sunday  rising virus cases in the city and Philadelphia s decision  I am not special as being the mayor  What happens to me personally should not determine how I make policies   Mr  Adams said   It should be what happens to the City of New York   I feel fine  no fever  no running nose  no aches and pains   the mayor said  adding that with his health history of diabetes   I would probably have had different outcomes if I was not vaccinated and boosted  Under Philadelphia s Covid response plan  mitigation measures are triggered when caseloads or case trajectories pass certain thresholds  Since early March  as Omicron swiftly receded  the city had been at Level    or  all clear   meaning most mandatory measures   including indoor mask mandates as well as proof of vaccine requirements in restaurants   had been lifted  Masks have no longer been required at city schools  though people visiting hospitals or riding public transportation still have had to wear them The indoor mask mandate is reinstated automatically when the city rises to Level    in which average new daily case counts and hospitalizations are still low but  cases have increased by more than    percent in the previous    days   The health departments spokesman said over the last    days case the average number of news cases had risen nearly    percent Philadelphia s system  allow us to be clear  transparent and predictable in our response to local Covid    conditions   said Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement after the announcement was made   I m optimistic that this step will help us control the case rate   he added The city s decision is at odds with the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Basing its designation on hospital admissions among other benchmarks  the C D C  considers Philadelphia to have a  low  community level  and thus does not advise required masking Asked about the difference  Dr  Bettigole emphasized that  local conditions do matter  in making these decisions  and brought up the inequities in the virus s impact   We ve all seen here in Philadelphia  how much our history of redlining  history of disparities has impacted  particularly our Black and brown communities in the city   she said   And so it does make sense to be more careful in Philadelphia  than  you know  perhaps in an affluent suburb  Jeffery C  Mays contributed reporting   Campbell Robertson A small number of U S  colleges and universities are reinstating mask policies  citing coronavirus outbreaks

more than        new coronavirus cases a day as of Sunday  according to a New York Times database    a   percent increase from two weeks ago  New York City and Washington  D C   have seen sharper increases  though the figures there remain well below earlier peaks  Several prominent officials and some Broadway stars have recently tested positive  With new cases low but rising sharply in recent days  the city of Philadelphia announced on Monday that it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate a little more than a month after lifting it  becoming the first major U S  city to do so During the winter surge driven by another form of Omicron  the BA   subvariant  some universities shifted to pandemic policies aimed at living with the virus rather than trying to keep it off campus completely   policies like using quarantines and social distancing when outbreaks occur  rather than canceling in person instruction altogether  As the numbers of new cases decreased  some colleges and universities further loosened precautions like surveillance testing programs  despite criticism from public health experts Now  while some universities like Harvard are letting professors decide for themselves which rules to follow in their classrooms  others are imposing new campuswide mask rules American University said on Monday that it would start requiring masks in all campus buildings  including medical facilities and the school s shuttles  beginning on Tuesday  Professors will be able to remove their masks in classrooms while teaching Columbia University said on Sunday that students would have to wear non cloth masks in classrooms for the remainder of the spring semester  through May     based on the current situation and in an abundance of caution   Last week  Barnard College  a women s undergraduate college affiliated with Columbia  reinstated its indoor mask rule Georgetown University announced last week that masks would be required inside any campus buildings until further notice because of campus Covid outbreaks   particularly among undergraduate students  George Washington University said Monday that its mask mandate would return and stay in place through commencement  the school s student newspaper reported  Officials quoted in the report cited the university s seven day positivity rate  which is nearing   percent after remaining close to   percent for much of the semester Johns Hopkins University said last week that it would require masks indoors  along with twice weekly testing of students  and noted that nearly     of its more than       undergraduate students had tested positive since April   Rice University reinstated its mask requirement for classrooms  regardless of vaccination status  Those who are unvaccinated must continue to wear a mask in other indoor areas as well Adeel Hassan contributed reporting   Giulia Heyward The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced on Monday that it was canceling a four city tour of Europe because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the United States The orchestra said the tour  which was to have included stops next month in Germany  Austria and France  was not feasible because of the potential for the virus to disrupt travel  The orchestra has recently reported a surge in cases among players and members of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus  Given the ongoing presence of Covid  brought home by its unfortunate impact on a significant number of our own artists  we must keep as our first priority the health and safety of everyone involved with the Boston Symphony Orchestra   Gail Samuel  the orchestra s president and chief executive  said in a statement   Sadly  the only prudent and responsible course of action is  with deep regret  to cancel the European tour  Many classical music ensembles hoped to resume global tours this year after the long hiatus brought by the pandemic  But the persistence of the Omicron variant has continued to complicate plans The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra recently announced it was canceling a tour of Japan and South Korea in June because of concerns about the virus Orchestra tours have been a staple of classical music going back decades  when the biggest ensembles in the United States and Europe began leading whistle stop visits to global capitals  In those days  tours served not just artistic purposes but also commercial ends  giving orchestras exposure to new markets and  occasionally  lucrative sponsorships Tours are no longer the moneymakers they used to be  except for a small number of elite ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic  But they bestow international prestige on orchestras   an attractive prospect for donors   and give ensembles an opportunity to build cohesion Overseas trips came to a halt at the outset of the pandemic  when classical touring was one of the first industries to shut down   At the end of January       before the disruptions caused by the coronavirus were widely felt in the United States  the Boston Symphony announced that it was canceling a tour of Asia  Other ensembles have plans to go overseas in the coming months  The New York Philharmonic is planning a residency at a festival in Usedom  Germany  next month  The Philadelphia Orchestra is planning a tour of Europe in late summer   Javier C  Hern ndez To Shanghai residents who have reached the limit of their patience with a lockdown that has kept them stuck at home for two weeks  a top health official has a message   We cannot let our guard down  Despite reports that the shutdown of daily life in Shanghai has caused food shortages and reduced access to medical care  Liang Wannian  a senior official at China s National Health Commission  said on Sunday that the lockdown was the best way to ensure  people first  lives first  Under the country s zero Covid strategy  Shanghai and more than a dozen other cities in China are under full or partial lockdowns to tackle spikes in Omicron cases of the coronavirus  The lockdowns are exposing a growing social and economic cost of the strategy  which has been abandoned nearly everywhere else in the world Other countries have lifted most restrictions  but  lying flat is not an option for China   Mr  Liang said  referring to the phenomenon of  lying flat   or relaxing  in the face of a challenge China s relatively low vaccination rate among older people and its limited health care resources for treating severe virus cases continue to worry officials and keep them from easing pandemic restrictions  There are around     million people over the age of    in China  and some    million of them have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus Infections among this group were inevitable  Mr  Liang said  but  we have to take it seriously   He spoke in an interview with Chinese state media Health authorities reported        new locally transmitted cases in China on Monday  most of them in Shanghai  a city of    million  That case count is small compared with many countries  but the recent surge  fueled by the Omicron variant  is the biggest that China has experienced so far China has reported more than         locally transmitted coronavirus cases in Shanghai since the current outbreak began last month  most of them mild or asymptomatic  The city has just one case that is currently categorized as  severe   officials said the case required hospital treatment but did not elaborate  No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak Mass testing  a key part of China s strategy to eliminate infections  has allowed health authorities to isolate patients who test positive and send them quickly to a hospital or isolation facility  The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said last week that it would test all    million of its residents  after a small number of locally transmitted cases   fewer than      were reported over the previous seven days  Officials in Shanghai announced a second round of mass testing for that city s    million residents over the weekend In the city of Wuhan  where the coronavirus first emerged  officials began on Monday to require residents wishing to use the city s subway to have had a negative result on a nucleic acid test within the past    hours  Passengers must show their test result and scan a code from the specific subway car they sit in  so that authorities can keep track of exposure  according to a notice posted online by the Wuhan Metro on Monday Though Mr  Liang indicated that China would not back down from its coronavirus strategy  authorities in Shanghai appeared to respond to a public outcry over the city s handling of the outbreak  The vice mayor said on Saturday that the city would begin to lift lockdown measures in neighborhoods that go    days without a new case  On Monday  the city announced a system to categorize districts based on the number of reported positive cases in each However  those moves will not do much to mitigate the lockdown s larger economic impact  some economists said  The extent of the lockdown is far more serious than people realize   said Bo Zhuang  a China analyst at the investment firm Loomis Sayles For most of last year  only a few cities in China were under lockdown at any one time  and the economic damage was manageable  Mr  Zhuang said  But these days  he estimated  the equivalent of around a quarter of China s economic output is on hold  Now we are talking about a couple of provinces under lockdown because of Omicron   Mr  Zhuang said   This would be a risk going forward  The growing frustration over having daily life disrupted is another risk When millions of people in Wuhan learned on Monday morning about the new rules imposed overnight concerning the city s subway system  many turned to social media to complain  Since Wuhan lifted the lockdown two years ago  it has issued the most stringent prevention and control measures   Zhai Haichao  a writer and a businessman  wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo   It s disturbing that we see no end of the pandemic    Alexandra Stevenson and Amy Chang Chien An experimental drug halved the death rate among critically ill Covid patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen and were at high risk for serious lung disease and death  the drug s developer announced on Monday There is a pressing need for new treatments for critically ill patients  Drugs like Paxlovid  made by Pfizer  are aimed primarily at patients who have mild or moderate disease  Other treatments administered to hospitalized patients in serious condition have shown limited effectiveness The new drug  sabizabulin  reduced deaths among hospitalized Covid    patients so drastically in a clinical trial that independent safety monitors recommended stopping it early  officials at Veru Inc   the drug s maker  said  The trial was halted on Friday The results of that trial have not been reviewed by outside experts or published in a medical journal  Veru announced the findings at an early morning news conference  The company s stock soared in trading Monday following the announcement About half of the    trial participants given a placebo or dummy pill along with regular care died within    days  an indicator of how very sick they were  But the death rate was    percent among the    participants who received sabizabulin  who were just as ill  The drug was given once a day for up to    days  Sabizabulin is the first drug to demonstrate a clinically and statistically meaningful reduction in deaths in hospitalized patients   Dr  Mitchell Steiner  chief executive of Veru  said   This represents a big step forward  Most Covid restrictions have been lifted in the United States after declining case numbers  but cases  hospitalizations and deaths around the world continue to be high  Dr  Steiner added  New variants are bound to emerge  and surges will follow Close to a million Americans have died of Covid  and there are still     fatalities every day on average The drug was granted so called fast track status by the Food and Drug Administration in January  Dr  Steiner said  The designation is intended to prompt faster development and review of new treatments that address unmet medical needs and target serious or life threatening conditions Dr  Steiner said the company plans to meet with the agency later this month and will be applying for emergency use authorization for sabizabulin  An F D A  spokeswoman declined to comment  saying the agency did not confirm  deny or comment on pending applications No safety concerns related to the drug were identified in the course of the clinical trial  company officials said   Roni Caryn Rabin GLOBAL ROUNDUPSouth Korea is set to ease social distancing

full reopening this week  We will see by how much we can adjust social distancing regulations   a senior health official  Son Young rae  said at a briefing on Friday  Officials say the goal is to lift restrictions altogether  though it will still be obligatory to wear a mask indoors South Korea received praise for its handling of the coronavirus in the early stages of the pandemic  but new cases

territory  increasing the number of opportunities for viruses to jump from species to species   including humans  By       if global temperatures continue to rise as predicted  there could be a total of        new cross species  viral sharing events   according to new research published today in the journal Nature  Of the at least        virus species in mammals capable of infecting humans  most are still only circulating among animals in the wild  The worry is that more of those viruses could eventually make the leap to humans  potentially sparking a health crisis like the COVID    pandemic  Ultimately  this work provides us with more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter but sicker   Gregory Albery  a disease ecologist at Georgetown University and co lead author of the study  said in a call with reporters  As global temperatures rise  many species might need to migrate because the climate they re used to living in is changing  Others might find that places that were once inhospitable   maybe they were too cold   are becoming more enticing  As they travel  they bring pathogens with them  Essentially  viruses now have more hosts with whom they can hitchhike long distances  That allows viruses to reach places and species that they otherwise wouldn t have had access to in the past   Even now  this process has likely been taking place  mostly unobserved and below the surface  and we need to start looking for it   Albery said When a virus passes from one species to another  it s called a  spillover  event  If spillover occurs between an animal and a human being  a zoonotic disease can emerge  The virus that causes COVID    is a zoonotic virus  which means it can move between humans and other animals  There s evidence the novel coronavirus originated in bats  But it probably jumped to at least one other animal before reaching humans The authors of the new study looked at potential changes to the geographical ranges of over       mammal species in a warming world  They also took into consideration how land use might change  say from deforestation and urban development  There could be over          first encounters  between different kinds of animals in a future with two degrees of global warming above pre industrial levels  the research shows  Most of those encounters would probably take place in tropical Asia and Africa  And that could lead to        transmission events in which at least one novel virus moves from one species to another  A majority of the projected viral sharing involves bats  which are unique among mammals because they can fly from continent to continent  The researchers stop short of estimating how often viruses might then hop over to humans  And not every virus that finds its way from an animal to a human triggers an epidemic  But Albery noted on the press call that when a virus jumps to a new species  it can create conditions that might help the virus evolve into one that s  particularly well suited or well placed to make the jump into humans   Take raccoons  which can thrive in forests  marshes  suburbs  and city centers  If those resourceful raccoons suddenly become susceptible to a new virus  they might be much more able to bring that virus into places where humans live  And since the virus has already made one leap from another kind of animal to a raccoon  then the virus has demonstrated that it s prone to jumping between species The new paper suggests that these trends are already underway and will be a problem even under some of the best case scenarios for future climate change  We re well on our way toward surpassing that two degree threshold  the world has already warmed by over one degree  The COVID    pandemic emerged shortly after this research was completed  which the authors say points to the urgent need to prepare for more spillover   We have to take that seriously as a real time threat   Georgetown University biologist Colin Carlson  another lead author of the study  said on the call   We have to acknowledge that climate change is going to be the biggest upstream driver of disease emergence  And we have to build health systems that are ready for that  That includes pairing surveillance of new viruses with observations of how species  geographic ranges are shifting  the authors say  It s part of a bigger movement to adopt a concept

cases Initially  there had been separate measures for the eastern and western sides  but the whole city is now subject to indefinite restrictions Shanghai is the largest single city to be locked down to date The important financial hub has battled a new wave of coronavirus infections for more than a month Reported cases have risen to more than        a day  although the numbers are not high by some international standards  Residents in some areas of the city said the strict policy meant no one was allowed to leave their housing compounds  not even to collect essential provisions They reported difficulties in ordering food and water online  with restrictions on when customers are able to place their orders  because of a shortage of supplies and delivery staff This country s  zero Covid  system is  at best  struggling to cope China has done Covid lockdowns before  but not on the scale of its financial mega city The logistical challenges required to confine    million people to their homes  while keeping them fed  are huge  Social media here is full of angry residents complaining that they can t order food because the delivery system is clogged up Centralised isolation facilities   many using only camp beds  with no showers or other facilities   are bursting with infected people squashed in next to one another One of China s few reliable media outlets  Caixin  has reported that close contacts of infected people will be moved to neighbouring provinces  This could potentially involve hundreds of thousands of Shanghai residents The Chinese government s complete elimination strategy has become something of a mantra  with the government ridiculing other countries for sacrificing their own people on the altar of opening up Some medical specialists here have tried to get the message through that  for a vaccinated person  catching the Omicron variant of Covid will probably not necessitate going to hospital   that you can simply ride it out at home until you recover Few people in China seem to be aware of this  Their officials and state media have kept it from them So the lockdowns continue and it s not only Shanghai closed right now  Jilin City      million people   Changchun  nine million   Xuzhou  nine million   the steel city of Tangshan      million  and various other towns and villages are keeping their residents indoors The strain on people  and the economic cost of it all  must be enormous The city is testing the limits of China s zero Covid strategy  amid growing public anger over quarantine rules The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus  But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run   Currently  Shanghai s epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage   said Wu Qianyu  an official with the municipal health commission   We must adhere to the general policy of dynamic clearance without hesitation  without wavering  On Monday  Shanghai reported a record        new asymptomatic coronavirus cases  after a city wide

study found that long covid patients taking part in a rehabilitation program in Ireland  conducted online  experienced noticeable improvements in how their fatigue affected their well being and daily functioning There is much that we re still unsure about when it comes to long covid  from its likely causes to how often it happens  estimates range from the single digits to over     of covid    cases   And we know even less about the best ways to help sufferers recover from it There are dedicated long covid clinics in the U S  and elsewhere  where patients might be given treatments like physical therapy  counseling  and medications to manage other conditions that could have arisen as a result  such as hypertension or diabetes  But information is sparse on how effective any of these interventions are at improving people s symptoms or their overall quality of life  The new research  presented this week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology   Infectious Diseases  provides some preliminary data to that end The pilot study included    people who reported covid related fatigue severe enough to impact their daily life  About two thirds had been dealing with their symptoms at least    weeks to a year after their initial covid diagnosis  while a third had been experiencing them for over a year  Nearly three fourths also reported breathing difficulties  and about half were experiencing cognitive dysfunction  often known as brain fog The rehab program they took part in was developed by occupational therapists at St James s Hospital and Trinity College in Ireland and was adapted from interventions they ve previously used to help patients with multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions  It involved three    minute sessions with an occupational therapist over a four week period  delivered online at the time due to pandemic precautions  These sessions focused on stress management  sleep hygiene  and training people to recognize the daily limits of their physical and mental energy before their symptoms worsen Level up your earbud gameApple has added premium features previously exclusive to its more luxurious AirPods Pro  such as spatial audio and water resistance Before and after the program  patients were asked via survey about their levels of fatigue  well being  and quality of life  By the end of the program  patients generally reported improvements in how they felt and in how their symptoms affected their lives  Initial results from our pilot program are highly promising   senior study author Louise Norris  an occupational therapist at St James s Hospital in a statement from the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases   They show equipping patients with a range of practical techniques can result in meaningful improvements in fatigue and quality of life  Patients also have fewer concerns about their wellbeing  These results do come from a small sample size and have yet to be peer reviewed  so they should be taken with added caution  The intervention also isn t necessarily addressing the root cause of the symptoms  which may include persistent infection or an autoimmune dysfunction caused by the original infection  But it may help restore people s ability to lead a functional life while dealing with their illness  the researchers note  And with the promising results from their pilot study now in hand  they ve already begun to collect additional data from more patients data that might someday show that these kinds of programs can be widely used to help patients find some semblance of normalcy again  There is an urgent need to find new and better ways of managing post covid fatigue and its wide ranging  and in some cases  devastating  effects on people s

Anyone can read what you share By Karrie JacobsThis article is part of our latest Design special report  about new creative pathways shaped by the pandemic As the first winter of the pandemic drew to a close  someone in my Twitter feed enthused about an app called Libby that made it especially easy to borrow and read library books  I downloaded it  input my New York Public Library card number and proceeded to binge  I devoured everything by and about Isaac Babel  who wrote stories based on his life in early   th century Odessa  and all of Mick Herron s Slough House books  about a group of sad  incompetent British spies Libby was created by OverDrive  a Cleveland based company that digitizes books and other publications and distributes them to    percent of North American libraries  The app debuted in      but  no surprise  had its biggest bump in growth in       a    percent increase in circulation compared with       What distinguishes Libby from other library apps  like the New York Public Library s SimplyE  is that it allows you to read on a Kindle  instead of  say  your phone   And it has a definite style  minimalist and sweet Libby suggests  intentionally or not  that public libraries  the actual buildings  are no longer necessary  that libraries have become   like everything and everyone else   place less purveyors of content  But if during the past couple of years you replaced in person library visits with an app  you may be missing out  What many public libraries have done  despite Covid and because of it  is consciously enhance their physical presence on the street and in the neighborhood My own heightened appreciation of the non virtual library began one chilly evening last October  I attended a performance of excerpts from a new opera called  A Marvelous Order   about the critic Jane Jacobs and her urban planning nemesis  Robert Moses  in essence  an opera about the value of public space  Appropriately  it was staged on the broad steps and fan shaped plaza in front of Brooklyn s Art Deco style Central Library  with the composer  Judd Greenstein  conducting a small ensemble of musicians and singers and with animated graphics by Joshua Frankel projected on either side of the library s ornate front entrance The plaza in front of the Central Library is probably the best outdoor space in Brooklyn s library system  which is separate from the New York Public Library system   Most of Brooklyn s    libraries  including its Carnegie buildings  dating from the early   th century  lack any kind of useful  accessible exterior space  Or so it seemed But in January       the library s chief strategy officer  David Giles  working with a team that included Annie Barrett of BAS Architecture  embarked on a meticulous study called  Activating Exteriors   to forge  in Ms  Barrett s words  a  connection between a civic institution and its neighborhood   The idea  initially  was to find ways to remove fences and other obstructions that rendered the libraries  grounds inaccessible to the public A few months after Covid hit  the long term project was transformed into what Ms  Barrett called a  deployable strategy   Said Mr  Giles   We pushed into tactical mode  The library decided it had to move at least some of its services outdoors  Even though the libraries were closed  the Wi Fi was left on and  over time  the Brooklyn Public Library installed signal boosting antennas atop most branches so that New Yorkers who lack home internet connections could have access to the web from outside  Then  at    or so branches  they positioned groups of cafe tables and chairs  plus the occasional book cart  wherever they would fit  on sidewalks or on narrow strips of grass But the boldest move was the invention of the  Roadway Reading Room   designed by Ms  Barrett and her firm  and based on the city Department of Transportation s standards for restaurant  streeteries   These little structures were intended to embody the gravitas associated with public libraries and also a whiff of grandeur   We weren t going to do things like string party lights across the sidewalk   Ms  Barrett recalled The elemental sheds  with distinctive  barrel vaulted roofs  were fabricated by Bednark Studio  a firm at the Brooklyn Navy Yard  painted an eye catching electric blue and deposited curbside in front of the Kensington  Crown Heights and Walt Whitman  Fort Greene  branches  According to Mr  Giles  the outdoor seating attracted both regular library patrons and random people looking for a spot to rest  Occasionally  police officers would use the tables to eat lunch  and  he told me   in Brighton Beach  people would play chess  The outdoor reading rooms were a bit neglected by the time I visited Walt Whitman in February  the chairs and tables had been removed and the structure was hemmed in by illegally parked cars  But the idea they represent   reinvention of the public library as a free form community hub   continues to evolve  And  as it happens  this evolution is what positioned some libraries to function especially well during the pandemic The new Greenpoint Library and Environmental Education Center  for example  funded in part by a    million grant from the settlement for ExxonMobil s massive Newtown Creek oil spill  was conceived as a disseminator of environmental awareness and knowledge  When it first opened in September       it could offer books only on a  grab and go  basis  But the design for its environmental mission  by the architecture firm Marble Fairbanks and landscape architecture firm SCAPE  provided an unusual amount of outdoor space  including a rooftop  reading garden   with bleachers for the readers and shrubbery for the birds  and a second rooftop lined with planters where community members could learn to cultivate vegetables and flowers  From the beginning we were investigating all the different ways that outdoor space would be used by the community   said the architect Karen Fairbanks  The rooftop spaces have been well used over the past year and a half for events including evening stargazing and workshops on subjects like technology for teens and sewing That the roof deck became a public library status symbol during a period when we could only safely gather outdoors is a happy accident  In Washington  D C   for instance  the Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo included a spacious roof garden in its renovation plans for the central branch of the city s Martin Luther King Jr  Memorial Library  a hard edge      Ludwig Mies van der Rohe building  Those plans were completed in       The rooftop terrace  however  with its verdant landscape of wild grasses and flowers  made its public debut in September        It s been by far the best used part of the building   said Richard Reyes Gavilan  executive director of the city s libraries The King roof deck is  at once  a place to temporarily escape the constraints of the virus and evidence of an underlying trend  Mr  Reyes Gavilan said   Libraries have been trying to figure out ways to make their buildings less transactional  We want people to come and stay for long periods of time to see the library as their co working space or their third place  Mecanoo  working with New York s Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners  also included a roof deck in its redesign of the long neglected Mid Manhattan Library  now renamed  for the project s biggest donor  the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library  On my first visit  on a warm autumn afternoon  I was astonished by the generosity of the concept  It is a public rooftop in the middle of Manhattan where you can sit quietly and read  or drink coffee  there s a branch of Amy s Bread   for as long as you d like  I would like to say that we were brilliant and foresaw Covid   Iris Weinshall  the New York Public Library s chief operating officer  told me  Instead the roof deck emerged from community gatherings where attendees argued for more and better meeting and event space Mecanoo s founding partner and creative director  Francine Houben  was offended by the American habit of wasting precious roof space on noisy HVAC systems  The architect worked with her team to devise an oddly shaped container in copper patina green  known as the  wizard s hat   to hide and muffle all the machinery  thereby liberating the roof  for the people  Of course  all of these efforts to expand the reach of the public library have been relatively modest  Elsewhere in the world  the notion that libraries are synonymous with openness has inspired bolder gestures The most spectacular  and  arguably  most conflicted  example may be the reading room of the Beijing Sub Center Library designed by the Norwegian firm Snohetta  Currently under construction  this indoor space encompasses more than four acres of undulating  glass enclosed terrain supported by columns that the architects liken to ginkgo trees  Picture Zion National Park  but with tiers of bleachers rather than rock formations   It s really designed to be a piece of nature   observed Snohetta s partner  Robert Greenwood   It s just so big that it feels like you are out in a valley  you re on a hillside  As Mr  Reyes Gavilan put it about the King Memorial Library roof deck   When I m up there on a warm day like today  people are so thankful that such a space exists   Or  as Ms  Houben  who argues that every library needs a garden  suggested   A library should be so nice that you bring your own book  right  Karrie Jacobs is a New York based writer specializing in architecture  design and urbanism AdvertisementThe move is aimed at giving the C D C  the option of reinstating the mask mandate  if needed  after a federal judge struck down the requirement The Biden administration says it may appeal a ruling that voided a mask mandate on public transport Biden says Americans should decide for themselves if they want to wear masks on public transportation Health experts express alarm at the ruling striking down the mask mandate on U S  public transit Experts are anxious as mask mandates fall Masks stay required for N Y C  public transit  taxis and ride share vehicles Masks come off  to the cheers of some and concern of others Several large U S  transit systems have removed mask mandates Nervous about flying  Here s why a mask will still help protect you even if others aren t wearing one The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it intended to appeal a Florida judge s ruling that struck down a federal mask requirement on airplanes  trains  buses and other public transportation   but only if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary The announcement from the Department of Justice came after a day of back and forth inside the White House  as administration officials faced a legal and political quandary  whether to let the judge s ruling stand or to fight it  knowing that an appeal could result in a higher court  perhaps the Supreme Court  ruling against the administration and setting a lasting precedent that could undercut the C D C  s authority In the end  the administration charted a careful course  publicly objecting to Monday s ruling but putting off a final decision about whether to contest it  The Justice Department and the C D C   disagree with the district court s decision and will appeal  subject to C D C  s conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health   the department said in a statement  You are in the position of having two horrible choices   said Lawrence O  Gostin  an expert in public health law at Georgetown University   One choice is to risk forever taking away C D C  s powers if this goes up to the   th Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court  And on the other hand   he added   if you let what I consider to be a lawless decision by this judge go forward  then C D C  is going to be gun shy about doing things that it deems effective for the protection of the American public  The mask mandate   which also applied to transportation hubs like airports and train stations  and even to ride sharing services like Uber   had been set to expire on May   even before the judge struck it down on Monday If the C D C  decides there is a public health basis for trying to reinstate and extend the mandate  the Justice Department will swiftly file an appeal  But if the C D C  decides otherwise  the administration will not appeal and the case will instead end as mooted   but without any signal of executive branch acquiescence to the judge s view of its authority The Justice Department  continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given C D C  to protect the public health   its statement said   That is an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve    Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Charlie Savage WASHINGTON   President Biden said on Tuesday that Americans should decide for themselves whether to wear masks  undercutting efforts by his administration to urge Americans to keep wearing face coverings on airplanes  trains and buses even after a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on public transport The decision to wear a mask is  up to them   Mr  Biden told reporters during a trip to New Hampshire to promote infrastructure spending The Biden administration intends to appeal the ruling  if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides that extending the measure is necessary The patchwork of messaging contributed to confusion less than    hours after the ruling was handed down  The president  caught somewhere between politics and science  left it up to Americans to make their own choices  His press secretary urged Americans to follow existing health guidance  because that is what the president would be doing  And Dr  Ashish K  Jha  the administration s coronavirus response coordinator  said on Twitter that he was disappointed in the ruling and that he  for one  would still wear masks on planes A wave of federal agencies  city transit authorities and private companies said that they would no longer require travelers to wear masks after a federal judge appointed by former President Donald J  Trump voided a mandate on Monday that had been in place since February of last year  Just days earlier  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended the mandate through May   to assess the state of the pandemic The ruling took officials inside the White House by surprise and frustrated them  two senior officials said  But on Tuesday  as travelers aboard airplanes took directions from pilots to unmask and riders aboard transit systems  including in Washington  went mask free  the Biden administration did not lay out a detailed plan to contest the ruling  even as public health experts warned that the C D C  s authority to prevent the spread of a contagious virus was on the line On Tuesday  Jen Psaki  the White House press secretary  said the decision to remove the masking decision should have been up to the C D C   not the courts  Public health decisions shouldn t be made by the courts  they should be made by public health experts   Ms  Psaki told reporters on board Air Force One  on the way to New Hampshire   We obviously feel confident in our authorities here given that we put the mask mandate in place and asked for    additional days to evaluate data based on public health information  But the administration s confidence in its ability to enforce masking requirements conflicted with the broader reality that many masking regulations seemed to dissolve within hours of the ruling   Some  including in New York City  are staying in place   The Transportation Security Administration said on Monday that it would stop enforcing the C D C  mandate  Several airlines  including Delta and United  told travelers that masks would not be required  some travelers learned the news midflight Some White House officials said they would try to combat an inaccurate assessment of the threat the virus poses to the public  After Delta told its passengers that the virus had  transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus   Kevin Munoz  a White House spokesman  tweeted that the virus was still a threat Beyond piecemeal responses  Mr  Biden s advisers have been trying to triage the effects of the ruling  agency by agency  to figure out what the response should be  one official said Dr  Julie Morita  the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who served on Mr  Biden s coronavirus advisory committee during his presidential transition  said that she hoped that the Biden administration would appeal the ruling  It really is undermining of the C D C  s public health authority to make requirements that really helps prevent disease transmission between states and internationally   Dr  Morita said in an interview  The agency  she said  needs to  have the authority to implement these protective measures    Katie Rogers Many public health experts reacted with alarm to a ruling by a federal judge in Florida on Monday striking down a requirement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that passengers wear masks on buses  trains and planes The ruling  which came less than a week after the C D C  had extended its order through May   and in the midst of a school vacation travel week  would curtail the ability of public health authorities to respond to the pandemic even as the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases rises again in the United States Videos posted on Twitter showed air passengers flinging off their masks mid flight and cheering after hearing announcements that the mandate had been scrapped  Some parents traveling with children too young to have been vaccinated expressed panic Brooke Tansley  a television producer and former Broadway performer  was on a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles with her two children  a   year old and an   month old  when the pilot announced that masks were no longer required   I was scared   all I could do was hope it s going to be OK   she said   There wasn t any other option  Dr  Lakshmi Ganapathi  who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School  pointed out that the ruling coincided with a recent rise in cases   I think it s extremely shortsighted and  if I were impolite  would say kind of stupid   she said   This ruling is ill timed  and it s not commensurate with public health principles  She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups  including low income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation  make them susceptible to infection  and that there is still no vaccine for very young children  Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations as protection may be overly optimistic as new variants emerge  Dr  Ganapathi said On Jan            the C D C  issued an order requiring people to wear masks while taking indoor public transportation and while in transportation hubs  In a statement released Tuesday  the agency said that as a result of Monday s court ruling  the order was no longer in effect and would not be enforced  although the agency  continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time  But even experts who had previously spoken out in favor of lifting the government mask mandate for passengers said they were troubled by the precedent that the federal judge s ruling could set Dr  Robert Wachter  who chairs the department of medicine at the University of California  San Francisco  and has recently said it is time to lift mask requirements  said the government needed to have the authority to issue mandates during public health crises  He called on the Biden administration to challenge the ruling  If this becomes a precedent  that a judge can overrule government and C D C  experts  that puts us in a problematic place for the next surge  the next pandemic  bioterrorism or who knows   Dr  Wachter said   Government needs to be able to act  and to imply government does not have that authority is deeply concerning  He noted that he would continue to wear a mask on flights and strongly encouraged his family and loved ones to do so  although he did not think the situation was sufficiently dire to justify a government mandate  Should you wear a mask when you re in an aluminum tube shoulder to shoulder with people for six hours   Dr  Wachter said   I think you should  and I will  The same argument applied on trains and buses  he said   My general feeling is that there is still enough virus around that I think it s prudent to wear a mask in tight indoor spaces when you re not sure of the vaccine status of the people around you and there s a fair amount of virus in the community  Saskia Popescu  an infectious disease epidemiologist who expressed concerns about lifting the mandate  said on Twitter on Tuesday that when it comes to air travel   removing masking requirements is a great way to ensure you re spreading Covid among a lot of people going to a lot of different regions  Victoria Kim contributed reporting   Roni Caryn Rabin Public health experts reacted with dismay to a federal judge s ruling on Monday that struck down a mask requirement for plane  bus and train passengers  expressing concern that the case would set a precedent that erodes the authority of public health agencies and hampers their ability to respond to health emergencies The Florida judge s ruling was issued less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control had extended its mask order through May    The ruling also came in the middle of a school vacation that coincides with several major religious holidays  when many families are traveling to see relatives  some for the first time in two years Many airplane passengers flung their masks off and cheered when pilots made announcements saying that the rule was no longer in effect  Others who have disabilities  are immunocompromised or were traveling with children too young to be vaccinated were caught off guard and distressed that the rules were changed literally mid flight  If this ruling stands  it could put the American public at great risk   said Dr  Richard Besser  president and chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the C D C  He added that his concerns were less to do with the immediate consequences for mask mandates than with  the implications for future crises  of the ability to put in place simple public health measures to keep people safe  Dr  Lakshmi Ganapathi  who teaches pediatrics at Harvard Medical School  pointed out that the ruling coincides with a recent rise in Covid cases nationally  driven by a rise in cases on the East Coast She noted that low booster rates among seniors and other vulnerable groups  including low income people who rely heavily on buses and trains for transportation  make them susceptible to infection  and there is still no vaccine for very young children  Banking on immunity from previous infections and vaccinations for protection may be overly optimistic  as emerging new variants could evade immunity  she said Moreover  the widespread use of home testing kits  the results of which go unreported  means that official case counts do not reflect the true number of new cases  A rise in hospitalizations is not a reliable or timely indicator of severity either  Dr  Ganapathi said  since hospitalizations rise several weeks after cases begin to increase   Once hospitalizations start rising  it s baked in   you haven t done anything to stop it   she said   And a proportion of those hospitalized will die    Roni Caryn Rabin Riders are still required to wear masks while taking public transportation in New York City  despite a federal judge in Florida s ruling on Monday to overturn the nationwide mask mandate on planes and public transit Major airlines across the country immediately dropped their mask requirements after the decision  moving so quickly that in some cases  masks became optional mid flight But as new confirmed coronavirus cases spurred by the rise of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA   rise around the country  leaders of New York City s public transit network  citing public health guidance from the state  are keeping mask requirements in place Tim Minton  a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  which operates New York s subway  bus and commuter rail networks  confirmed on Monday evening the mandate would remain in effect He pointed to a March   decision by the New York state health commissioner laying out the protections mask wearing offers from transmitting the virus  especially on public transportation The M T A  falls under state control  and Gov  Kathy Hochul voiced her support for keeping the mandate on Tuesday  while also emphasizing the importance of vaccinations and regular testing  Do your part to keep your neighbors safe   she wrote on Twitter The city s Taxi   Limousine Commission  which oversees taxis and for hire vehicles  including Ubers and Lyfts  said on Tuesday that drivers and riders in those vehicles would continue to be required to wear masks as well Uber had said on Tuesday that it would stop requiring masks in the United States  Lyft followed with a similar announcement  but both companies said local regulations would supersede their own rules The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  which operates the three major airports in the New York metropolitan area as well as interstate buses and bus terminals  said it would follow the local guidance in each state  Mask mandates remain in effect on the interstate PATH system and in two of the area s three airports  Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia  which are both in New York City But in neighboring New Jersey  Gov  Philip D  Murphy ended the mask mandate for New Jersey Transit and facilities operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority  including the Atlantic City International Airport  Masks will also no longer be required at Newark Liberty International Airport  the third major airport operated by the Port Authority  or at airports in Connecticut Several health experts urged caution about rolling back mask mandates on public transport  Dr  Linsey Marr  an expert on airborne disease transmission  said although the city s subway system has good air filtration and ventilation systems  those tools are no match for crowded buses or trains packed shoulder to shoulder with riders   Ashley Wong and Ana Ley In the wake of a judge s ruling on Monday that struck down a federal mandate  it is now up to each individual to decide whether to wear a mask on most commercial flights in the United States Some people were glad to say good riddance to an inconvenience that they thought did little good and was no longer necessary  But quite a few said in interviews on Tuesday that they would stick with masks for now  even though they no longer had to Candice Bailey      was one of the holdouts   Just to protect myself and to protect others  I continue to wear a mask   Ms  Bailey said Tuesday morning at the airport in New Orleans as she waited to board a flight home to Greensboro  N C  She said it was much too soon to know whether it was safe to set masks aside  especially  with the new variants that keep popping up  With most travelers at the airport exposing their faces  Rachel Gordon  a    year old science writer from Cambridge  Mass   acknowledged that she was bucking the trend   I tend to be an outlier  because I do favor more conservative masking rules than my peers   she said Ms  Gordon said that she did so out of empathy for vulnerable people  When side effects from her second dose of vaccine  completely immobilized  her for a time  she said   that gave me insight into what it might be like to get Covid without it  Count Lois Strickland      a track and field coach from Smithsburg  Md   among those who were glad to see the mandate go  I m tired of it  OK   she said as she waited to board a flight to Washington   I ve already had Covid  I ve already been vaccinated  I m over it  She noted that masks were no longer being required at many concerts and sporting events   You don t have to wear them there  why do we need them on public transportation  The end of the mandate was a welcome relief for Carlos Perales      a Chicago man who flew home from Florida on Tuesday with his wife  Yuliana  and two young daughters  aged   and    It s hard to travel with young kids and make them keep it on   Mr  Perales said  And Abi Miller of South Bend  Ind   expressed hope that dropping the mandate would reduce the number of angry confrontations and fights on airplanes  which grew more common during the pandemic   I figured I wouldn t have to have my phone ready to record an incident   she said Samuel Oluwafemi said he found out about the end of the mandate when he landed at Salt Lake City Monday night on the first leg of his trip home to Atlanta from Honolulu  He skipped the mask for the second leg  but then put it on again as the plane neared the airport because he thought it might still be required on the ground and in the Uber car he would take home  it wasn t   Honestly  even now that I know  I ll probably still wear a mask in the Uber  just to be safe   he said   I m just used to it now  Peter Shankman      saw more value in mask wearing than just Covid safety  He travels frequently for his job as a corporate keynote speaker  and he said that since he began wearing a mask on flights  he has been getting sick far less frequently  I might continue it   he said  adding   It s a little piece of fabric  it s not that inconvenient  For some travelers  the issue was complicated  Geoff Grubb      a customer review specialist  wasn t wearing a mask during a layover in New Orleans Tuesday  but he said he never minded wearing one He said his    year old father did mind  and had enough trouble breathing with a mask on that he avoided places that required them Mr  Grubb said he wore a mask as he went through security at the Austin airport  but took it off at the gate where people were more spread out  If someone had asked him to  he said  he would have put it back on without complaint  I don t see anything in the Constitution that we have a right not to wear a mask   he said   Elisabeth Goodridge  Tariro Mzezewa  Heather Murphy  Robert Chiarito and Patrick J  Lyons As major U S  airlines dropped their mask mandates in response to a federal judge s ruling  public transit systems across the country scrambled to adapt on Tuesday  New York  San Francisco and Milwaukee kept requirements in place  while systems in Atlanta  Chicago  Washington and Philadelphia allowed riders to drop their masks  as did the nationwide Amtrak rail system In Philadelphia  the decision led to an odd juxtaposition  The city last week reinstated its mask mandate for indoor public spaces  becoming the first major U S  city to do so this spring  But a statement late Monday announced an end to the requirement on city trains and buses  and in stations and concourses Officials with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority  or SEPTA  wrestled with a response to the judge s ruling   It was a bit of a scramble   said Andrew Busch  the Philadelphia agency s spokesman  The overriding concern was that keeping the mask requirement would create challenges for employees charged with enforcing it  who have already faced pushback and harassment  We wanted to try to reassure our employees that they wouldn t be in a difficult position of trying to figure out how to tell people that this was required  when the mechanism for requiring it was no longer in place   Mr  Busch said Transit agencies in several other cities lifted their mandates on Tuesday  including on the Los Angeles Metro Bus and Rail system In Boston  less than a day after the local transit agency said masks were still required on subways and buses  officials announced a reversal  Mask mandates were also lifted at Boston Logan International Airport and at most regional transit authorities across Massachusetts After the Illinois governor amended a state mask mandate  both the Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago s commuter rail system  Metra  announced that masks would no longer be required Mask mandates were retained in some cities  however  including Portland s TriMet agency and the operator of San Francisco s city bus system and Bay Area Rapid Transit The patchwork of responses underscored the uncertainty of the current phase of the pandemic  The Omicron subvariant known as BA   has reversed a nationwide decline in new cases   a trend that can be seen even with diminishing test data  But the virus is spreading in a country that is better vaccinated than during previous surges  and so far  an increase in hospitalizations has not followed the rise in infections Even in places that have kept mask requirements  enforcement has long been virtually nonexistent on trains and buses  In Atlanta  where a mandate was in place until Tuesday  Aida Smith      said that she had stopped masking on public transit after she was vaccinated against the coronavirus last year  I feel like a lot of other people here did the same thing   got vaccinated and stopped wearing a mask   she said Darren Kettle  the chief executive of Metrolink  a commuter rail system that serves six large Southern California counties  said that officials spent most of the day on Monday figuring out what exactly the federal court ruling meant But once he got word that the Transportation Security Administration would be lifting its mask requirement  he said  Metrolink decided to follow suit   Not having this in place now gives people peace of mind that at least our conductors aren t having to enforce something that was very difficult to enforce   he said   Jill Cowan  Sophie Kasakove  Tariro Mzezewa  Robert Chiarito and Matt Berg Masks work best when everyone around you is wearing one  That s because when a person infected with the coronavirus wears a mask  a large percentage of the infectious particles they exhale are trapped  stopping viral spread at the source  And when fewer viral particles are floating around the room  the masks others are wearing are likely to block those particles that have escaped But there is also plenty of evidence showing that masks protect the wearer  even when others around them are mask free The amount of protection depends on the quality of the mask and how well it fits  Health experts recommend using an N    KN   or KF   to protect yourself against the Omicron subvariant known as BA    which is now the dominant version of the coronavirus and is far more infectious than previous forms Other variables  such as how much time you are exposed to an infected person and how well a space is ventilated  also will affect your risk On most planes  for example  the cabin air is frequently pumped through high efficiency particulate air  HEPA  filters that are pretty good at reducing virus transmission  But that does not completely eliminate your risk In a modeling study  published in December       researchers found that passengers sitting in the same row or one row away from someone with the virus still had a high risk of getting infected through direct respiratory droplets  Wearing a mask reduced the risk of infection by    percent In closed settings like a plane  it can be hard to avoid a mixed group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people  symptomatic or asymptomatic people  all of whom may transmit the coronavirus at varying levels  And the flight may not even be the riskiest part of a trip Air circulation may be running at low strength or completely turned off during boarding and deplaning  so those periods  as well as the time you spend at the airport  may be when you are at most risk of exposure and may benefit from wearing a mask Other settings may be even more worrisome  I know everyone talks about planes  but I would say buses are probably the riskiest  then trains and then planes  in order of highest to lowest   said Linsey Marr  an expert in aerosol transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech  People talk about planes having great ventilation filtration  and they do and that greatly helps reduce the risk of transmission   she added   But the virus is going to be in the air  no question in my mind  because there s still large numbers of cases  There is real world data supporting the protective effects of masking in other indoor locations  In a      investigation of a hotel outbreak in Switzerland  for instance  several employees and a guest who tested positive for the coronavirus were wearing only face shields  with no masks   those who wore masks were not infected A number of laboratory studies  too  have documented that a mask protects the person who is wearing it  though the level of that protection can vary depending on the type of mask  the material it is made from  the experimental setup and how particle exposure was measured While the lab studies all show a mask can protect the wearer  how well the masks perform in the real world depends on a number of variables  including how consistently people use them  whether a person is in high risk situations and the rate of infection in the community The laboratory studies showed that a high quality medical mask  like an N    KN   or KF    works best  While vaccination and a booster shot or two provide the best protection against infection with the coronavirus  even vaccinated people should be cautious around crowds or large groups indoors when the vaccination status of others is not known Dr  Marr recommends wearing the highest quality mask possible when you can t keep your distance or be outdoors   or when nobody around you is masking up  That means an N   or its equivalent Sharon Otterman contributed reporting   Tara Parker Pope and Knvul Sheikh After a federal judge struck down the United States mask mandate for planes  trains  buses and other public transportation on Monday  several European airlines made mask wearing optional for passengers on their trans Atlantic flights The rules in Europe were already shifting  and a number of European countries were well ahead of the United States in easing coronavirus travel restrictions  including mask mandates and pre departure testing for air travel  Many European airlines have been requiring passengers and crew members to wear face coverings only on flights to countries that require them Britain dropped all its remaining coronavirus travel restrictions last month  and British Airways and Virgin Atlantic were among the first carriers to make mask wearing optional  unless the destination required masks  Both airlines updated their mask policies on Tuesday to make masks optional on flights to U S  destinations  We encourage everyone to be respectful of fellow passengers  mask preferences  and across our network  we continue to adhere to all regulatory requirements  recognizing that mask requirements differ by market   Virgin Atlantic said in a statement on Tuesday Other European airlines  like Air France and Lufthansa  said they would continue to enforce mask mandates on all their routes  in line with French and German coronavirus regulations  The Dutch airline KLM stopped enforcing mask mandates last month  but said it  strongly recommends  that passengers wear them  in line with guidance from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency   Ceylan Yeginsu For many flight attendants  the striking down of the mask mandate for planes brought relief on Tuesday Flight crews have faced a surge in threats and violence from passengers during the pandemic  In many cases  the rage is sparked by resistance to complying with the mask mandate  which is enforced by the crews on planes  I ve got nothing but extremely positive feedback   said John Samuelsen  the international president of the Transport Workers Union  which represents thousands of flight attendants and other airline  railroad and transit workers   There was and remains a tension in the air  David Neeleman  the founder of JetBlue Airways who is now chief executive of Breeze Airways  said that he and many of his crew members welcomed the news   They don t like being policemen on airplanes   he said   It s not something that they signed up for  and I think it creates more agitation with customers  Unions representing flight attendants and pilots have long called for stronger action to address the increase in violence  with many welcoming a proposed bill in Congress that would impose tougher penalties for those convicted of assaulting flight crews and place those individuals on a no fly list For flight attendants who choose to do so  being able to work without masks may also help them to regain an important tool for de escalating conflicts  too  Even just a smile  even just to say  good morning    good afternoon    welcome aboard   hopefully that will help to decrease tension on board as well   said Lyn Montgomery  president of TWU Local      which represents about        Southwest Airlines flight attendants   It seems like a little thing  but it s actually something we use quite a lot  The new policy also created issues  Yesterday s mid flight announcements on the lifting of mask mandates created confusion and uncertainty in our cabins   Sara Nelson  the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union  said in a statement At Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning  most agents with the Transportation Security Administration kept their faces covered  at least at the Terminal   security checkpoint A masked agent  who was checking luggage  stood next to a bare faced colleague  Around the airport  blue signs reminded travelers   Masks required  All travelers and employees must wear a face covering over their nose and mouth while in the airport   Of three gate agents at D   only one kept his face covered  Two pilots strode maskless through the terminal and onto a plane Pilots seemed to be in a buoyant mood on Monday evening  In a widely shared video  passengers on a flight from Seattle to Juneau  Alaska  were heard applauding after a pilot congratulated them for being able to remove their masks Jonathan Russell Biehl  a pilot for Delta Air Lines  was midway between Tampa and Minneapolis when he got a message about the dropping of the mask rule   I would say this is the day I ve been waiting for a long time   Mr  Biehl      said on Tuesday   It s really exciting not to have to be forced to wear a mask against my will  It was not immediately clear what effect the removal of mask requirements would have on travel demand  Airlines are enjoying a robust rebound  Last week  Delta reported that March was its best sales month ever   Niraj Chokshi  Heather Murphy and Kristin Hussey The announcement by major U S  airlines on Monday that they would drop mask mandates after a federal judge struck down the nationwide requirement has raised fresh questions about Covid safety on flights On most single aisle planes  you are constantly breathing a mixture of fresh and recirculated air  The air in the cabin is filtered and refreshed roughly every two to three minutes   a higher rate than in grocery stores and other indoor spaces  experts say  It s one reason  in addition to safety protocols  that there have not been many superspreader events documented on flights since the beginning of the pandemic But that doesn t mean flights are completely safe In early       with the help of researchers  The New York Times simulated more than   million air particles to understand how they flow within the cabin  and how potential viral elements may pose a risk As air blows from the sides of the plane  particles move toward the aisle  where they combine with air from the opposite row  To prevent air from circulating throughout the cabin  the ventilation system keeps it contained to a few rows Not all particles are the same size  and most don t contain infectious viral matter  But if someone were to sneeze  for example  even if that person were wearing a mask  the chances of passengers nearby inhaling viral particles greatly increase See how the ventilation system works   Mika Gr ndahl As vaccines become widely available and restrictions are eased  millions of people are flying again  raising questions about just how safe it is now to board a flight Moderna announced preliminary results Tuesday from its study of a coronavirus vaccine intended to protect against variants  saying the findings show it can design a vaccine that offers better  longer lasting protection than its initial product But the company said it was also testing another version of the vaccine that it expected would do even better  with results expected in late May or early June The company s findings  published in a paper without being evaluated by outside scientists  offer hope that the nation will have a better vaccine by the fall  when the coronavirus is considered likely to re emerge in force Researchers at Moderna  other pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health have been racing to figure out how to redesign the existing vaccines in time for new booster doses to be manufactured over the summer  Moderna s results are the first of their kind to be released The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech continue to strongly protect most people from hospitalization and death caused by Covid     But their potency against infection wanes quickly  Federal officials recently authorized additional shots for people    and older  citing concerns about waning protection against severe disease in vulnerable populations Moderna said its research showed the promise of a so called bivalent vaccine  even against other variants besides the two versions of the virus specifically targeted  In this case  researchers combined the existing vaccine with one designed to attack the Beta variant  which was first detected in late       They found the combination provided a stronger defense not only against those forms of the virus  but also against the Delta and Omicron variants  the company said Volunteers who got a booster shot of the reconfigured vaccine produced more than two times the level of antibodies against the Omicron variant compared with those who got a booster dose of the existing Moderna vaccine  The added protection persisted for six months against the Omicron variant but fell against Delta to essentially the same level as that elicited by the existing vaccine  the study showed Moderna said although Beta was an early variant  it was relevant to test because it contains several mutations that  have been persistent in more recent variants of concern  including Omicron    Sharon LaFraniere After two years of warning travelers to avoid visiting a very long list of countries deemed to be  high risk  for coronavirus infection  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped them all from its list The change happened on Monday because the C D C  revised its international Covid    travel advisory system  and now reserves its most serious warning category  Level    for extreme situations like  rapidly escalating case trajectory or extremely high case counts  emergence of a new variant of concern  and health care infrastructure collapse   the C D C  said in an update  Previously  the agency determined which countries warranted Level   warnings based on counts of new coronavirus cases The U S  Travel Association and airline executives have asked the C D C  and the Biden administration to ease restrictions and mask mandates for international travel in order to help airlines bounce back from a steep loss of business during the pandemic  A judge struck down the federal mask mandate for public transportation on Monday  prompting many airlines to immediately drop their mask requirements Before the C D C  revised its advisory system on Monday  more than    countries were in the Level   category  including Costa Rica  France and Iceland Levels      and   in the system continue to be determined primarily by new case counts over the most recent    days  Countries and territories with a  high level of Covid        currently      of them   are put in Level   and those with a  moderate level of Covid     are put in Level     currently a dozen   The United States also qualifies for Level    Travelers who are not fully vaccinated are advised to avoid traveling to Level   or Level   countries entirely  and people with weak immune systems are advised to speak to their doctors about how to stay safe when traveling there Countries with a  low level of Covid       currently    of them   are put in Level    and the C D C  recommends that travelers be up to date with vaccines before visiting them Some    countries and territories are not assigned any level in the travel advisory system because not enough data was available  The C D C  warns travelers who are not fully vaccinated to avoid such places  many are small and remote  but some are tourist destinations Although there are no longer any blanket  do not travel  warnings related to the coronavirus  travelers should still be aware that many countries have pandemic related entry requirements  And the C D C  has issued warnings over issues unrelated to the coronavirus  like the lack of medical infrastructure in Venezuela and polio in Africa  Asia and Eastern Europe The State Department said last week that it would adjust its own travel advisories and would no longer automatically correlate its guidance with the C D C  s  Even so  if the C D C  assigns a country to Level   because of pandemic risk  the State Department s travel advisory for that destination will also rise to Level     Isabella Grull n Paz On Monday  a federal judge struck down a nationwide mask mandate on airplanes  trains  buses and other public transportation  The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do  By late Monday  the nation s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights  and the Amtrak rail system had lifted its mandate For many  the announcement was welcomed  Travelers who were already on their way when the announcement came cheered and de masked midflight  Some employees said they had been frustrated by having to police passengers  But for others  the announcement has been met with alarm and concern about the spread of the coronavirus Our reporters want to know how you feel about the announcement and whether it will change your masking behavior Tell us your perspective below  We won t use your name or identifying

a reason for a refund for bookings made on or after this date   the company said in a press release  This updated policy doesn t apply to reservations made in South Korea and China  Airbnb quickly pivoted to say that other companies in the travel industry also rolled back similar policies earlier this year  or didn t provide one at all  While Airbnb did not specify which of their competitors they were referring to  Vrbo  a similar service  has also recently updated its guidelines related to Covid    related cancelations  saying a property s cancelation policy may apply even if a reservation is impacted by Covid    Airbnb did say that two thirds of the listings on their site offered guests the chance to cancel a reservation no less than   days before check in for a full refund  Some listings even offer full refunds for cancellation up to    hours before check in  So  there s still a chance you could get your money back if something comes up  The news comes after yesterday s companywide announcement that Airbnb would be moving to a hybrid work schedule  which would allow employees to live and work wherever they want  de centralizing the office from the company s culture  While this shift to a permanent hybrid work configuration doesn t seem to be directly due to the current state of Covid     which Dr  Anthony Fauci claimed is no longer a pandemic in the U S    it is clearly fueled by the shift to remote work that began in March       Two years ago  the world was turned upside down  Our offices closed and we found ourselves working from our bedrooms  basements  and home offices   CEO Brian Chesky wrote to Airbnb employees in an email  He continued  The right solution should combine the best of the digital world and the best of the physical world  It should have the efficiency of Zoom  while providing the meaningful human connection that only happens when people come together  We have a solution that we think combines the best of both worlds Level up

storyAs a subscriber  you have    gift articles to give each month  Anyone can read what you share By Peter Baker and Aishvarya KaviWASHINGTON   Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday  becoming the latest high ranking official in Washington to be infected amid renewed concern about President Biden s potential exposure as the virus ripples through his administration Ms  Harris received her test results shortly after returning to the White House following several days in California  then left the West Wing without seeing Mr  Biden to isolate at the vice president s residence  While she typically sees the president most weekdays they are both in town  aides said she had not been with him in person in eight days Two Democratic senators  Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher S  Murphy of Connecticut  also tested positive on Tuesday  depriving Democrats of a working majority to push through legislation or nominations for the next few days  In an evenly split Senate  Democrats need every member plus the vice president s tiebreaking vote to overcome uniform Republican opposition Senate Democrats had hoped to approve multiple nominations this week  including Lisa D  Cook to be a governor of the Federal Reserve and Alvaro Bedoya to be a member of the Federal Trade Commission  Given that neither received any Republican support during earlier procedural votes  the latest Covid absences scrambled the equation for Democrats While Ms  Harris by happenstance has not been near Mr  Biden in recent days  her infection served as a reminder of the dangers for Mr  Biden  who at    is the oldest person ever sworn into the presidency and in an age group considered more vulnerable to the virus  He has been traveling and appearing in public more lately  including three trips out of town last week  which increases his potential exposure  and aides on Tuesday sounded resigned to the prospect that he may be infected eventually  It is possible he could test positive for Covid  just like any American   said Jen Psaki  the White House press secretary   Even though he s double boosted  that is possible  And we will be very transparent if that were to take place  She said the president and his staff make a risk assessment for his travels outside the White House and he has proceeded lately with trips that he considers  vitally important to him  to his presidency  to the American people  Mr  Biden plans to deliver a eulogy for former Secretary of State Madeleine K  Albright at a memorial service on Wednesday at Washington National Cathedral  where he will be among an estimated       mourners  including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  Mr  Biden is also scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents  Association annual dinner on Saturday night  along with about       officials  journalists and others in a basement hotel ballroom The most recent of these big Washington grip and grin dinners led to an extensive outbreak that swept through much of the capital s elite  At least    guests at the Gridiron Dinner last month tested positive afterward  including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three members of Mr  Biden s cabinet  Attorney General Merrick B  Garland  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack Ms  Harris was not at the dinner  but her communications director  Jamal Simmons  attended and tested positive afterward  The infections of both the vice president and House speaker mean that the first and second in line of succession to the presidency have now been hit by the virus in short order Ms  Harris      received her second booster shot on April    three days after federal regulators authorized a second dose of the vaccine for people over age     It takes about a week for a shot to boost the immune system  Mr  Biden has also received a second booster shot  The last time the two were together was on April     according to a White House official Ms  Harris  who returned from a trip to San Francisco and Los Angeles on Monday  went to her office at the White House on Tuesday morning and took a rapid antigen test as part of the regular protocol for the president and vice president  When it came back positive  she took a P C R  test  which also came back positive  At that point  rather than attend the daily intelligence briefing with the president as scheduled  she returned home  where aides said she would remain until she tests negative  Mr  Biden later called to check in on her  aides said After consulting her doctors  Ms  Harris also started a course of Paxlovid  her press secretary said in a tweet  The antiviral pill made by Pfizer is intended for high risk patients  and it was not immediately clear whether she qualified Doug Emhoff  Ms  Harris s husband  tested positive for the virus in mid March  At the time  Ms  Harris was forced to back out of an event with the president  although she continued to test negative  Mr  Emhoff told McClatchy News last week that he had isolated from his wife for    days while infected  staying in an upstairs room and having food brought up to him The spate of infections in the upper reaches of Washington came amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant known as BA    and served as a reminder that the pandemic endures even as officials seek to roll back restrictions Officials in the White House said they were contact tracing to determine who may have been near Ms  Harris in recent days  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a close contact as someone who spends at least    minutes within six feet of the infected person over a    hour period  Officials have repeatedly emphasized that the

have died after contracting Covid     but official government figures claim no deaths in the city have been caused by the disease since      The BBC has spoken to a hospital manager and had access to correspondence sent to relatives of patients who ve died during the Omicron outbreak that is sweeping through China s biggest city We ve also had access to official documents that suggest at least    patients from a single hospital  who weren t vaccinated  have died from what it called  underlying health problems  Shanghai is enforcing a mammoth lockdown as authorities try to contain a new wave of the virus  Most of the city s almost    million population have been ordered to stay inside for three weeks The BBC has previously reported evidence that authorities in Shanghai are struggling to deal with the outbreak  We spoke to a nurse and a health worker at Donghai Elderly Care Hospital who  between them  described desperate attempts to help dozens of elderly patients  some of whom have died We ve contacted several other care homes or hospitals for the elderly since then  after social media postings suggested there was evidence of widespread infections among hundreds of patients in    other facilities here One relative of a patient at another care home in Shanghai has told us that doctors and caregivers working there had informed her that everyone in the facility had tested positive  It has capacity for around     patients In a phone conversation a manager at Donghai Hospital told us   Of course there would be deceased with Covid   In  Shanghai the situation is like this  How could there not be any death s  without Covid  In a letter sent to relatives of patients who d died management at the hospital apologised and admitted a  lack of professionalism   They also expressed their  deepest guilt  Official figures say there have been no deaths during the current outbreak across the city  none at all  China has a strict criteria for confirming Covid    cases  which includes evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus  This must be confirmed in a scan Any underlying health conditions is also considered before deaths are officially attributed to Covid One man whose    year old sister died at Donghai earlier this month told us that he had struggled to get a full explanation from officials about the cause of death  He told us that she had tested negative in the weeks before she died on   April  But he was not able to get a record of her test results in the final days before she died The man said his sister was one of six patients in a room  five of whom died  He told the BBC that  the outbreak  was  so bad in that care home   As far as he could tell the official record said  she died with Covid negative   He said he would not go ahead with her cremation until he knew what the cause of death was Relatives of a    year old woman who died on   April have also raised concerns about the cause of death  given that she tested positive in the final week of her life In social media postings seen by the BBC  with accompanying audio records  her granddaughter said the woman had been transferred to Jinshan Public Health Clinical Centre in Shanghai on    March  where she tested positive a day later She was treated for underlying health problems  Three days later she tested negative for Covid  A day later she died  The woman described her death as due to  aggravation of underlying disease due to Covid   The BBC tried multiple times to contact authorities at Donghai and Jinshan regarding the various allegations  but was not able to get a response China is facing its most serious crisis since the virus first emerged here in early       when the city of Wuhan was locked down and sealed off Despite efforts to limit

              " 'So that theory is a bit questionable.And then finally, the last argument that I heard quite a bit had to do with other pathogens that people have either been exposed to so many other coronaviruses that they had protection against Covid, or just that if you make it into adulthood in a place like Sierra Leone, you’ve had repeated bouts of malaria.',\n",

              "'And it really seemed like Covid was just not a thing people were thinking or talking about at all when I would ask people, are you worried about Covid? India has reported half a million Covid deaths, but it’s pretty widely accepted that the real number is probably closer to 4 million people who’ve died of the virus. There’s really interesting data from the World Health Organization that just came out that shows that two-thirds of people across sub-Saharan Africa have Covid antibodies. The reason that they would be reporting fewer people dying of Covid is just that we do a really bad job of counting them. Russia said it would do so more than two weeks ago, but Pentagon officials had expressed skepticism that the self-proclaimed pullout could be a ruse. It was like time travel back to 2019, like I had landed in a place before Covid somehow.And right away, I thought, I need to understand what’s happening here. But what the health minister is telling you is that very few people in Sierra Leone died.Well, so there I am with a whole new mystery, right? And he said, look, there’s just no reason to think that fewer Zambians would be dying or Ethiopians or Sierra Leoneans, right? There are lots of other pathogens in circulation, so people would have had prior exposure to lots of things.So we know that those factors were not protective in India. And remember, when these studies were done, only 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent of people had had access to vaccination. I mean, if it’s clear that cases were being undercounted, then probably deaths were being undercounted, right?Yeah, I think this is a really strong argument. So it sounds like, Stephanie, from what you’re saying, Sierra Leone and a lot of sub-Saharan Africa reported really low case counts during the pandemic. One person died, two people died. There is a goal from the World Health Organization and the African Union to vaccinate 70 percent of people. And number two, at the hospital, they have so many other urgent diseases, malaria, for example, that Covid is just really the last thing on their list.Exactly. There’s other data sources, looking particularly at West Africa, that show that 75 percent of people have got Covid antibodies. I mean, a place like Sierra Leone holds really, really big funerals. He said to me there’s just no way, there’s just no way that we have missed millions of deaths. The virus is far less likely to kill young people. People knew about care.And so they had all that to draw on when they first got the news about Covid.So that gives us a headstart. But when you look here, you see that people are still getting sick. You’ve been exposed to lots of other infectious disease, that maybe people just have a level of immunity that has helped blunt the effect of Covid.Hmm. This is The Daily.Throughout the pandemic, as countries have struggled with disease and death, one part of the world seems to have been mysteriously spared— Central and Western Africa. How confident are you in your surveillance?I said, what do we actually know about how much Covid there is here? But data suggests that a lot of people actually have the antibodies, had Covid. It’s not getting anywhere near the level of attention that I feel like it should because it really matters, right? The vice mayor said on Saturday that the city would begin to lift lockdown measures in neighborhoods that go 14 days without a new case. It was really devastating for Sierra Leone.When we had Ebola here, people knew what hand-sanitizing was. 2022Feb.MarchSource: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBy The New York TimesWhat might help?Employer and customer mandates would probably nudge more people to get initial shots. And he said the testing was happening over at the hospital. And in fact, Dr. Demby said this to me pretty much point blank in our conversation. We know that death registration in much of sub-Saharan Africa is really, really poorly done. Grubb said he wore a mask as he went through security at the Austin airport, but took it off at the gate where people were more spread out. I would say there are artificial trade-offs between addressing one disease or another. And when I said, what are you doing in terms of Covid testing, they were pretty blunt. It’s also a really warm place where much of life is lived outdoors. There have been reports of people having to leave bodies outside hospitals because the morgues were full. People knew about not getting in crowds or whatever, social distancing. A booster shot sharply reduces the chances of severe Covid illness, especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and immunocompromised.I know that last point may sound counterintuitive. And because Sierra Leone gets nowhere near the amount of support that it needs to try to build a really functional health system, he’s facing these trade-offs. I mean, public health authorities have been trying to vaccinate 70 percent of Africa. And I was coming from Canada, which was a country really in the grip of another wave of the pandemic.'"
